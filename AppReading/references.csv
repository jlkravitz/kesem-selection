"34","Eryn ","Yuen","eryuen@berkeley.edu","9092721401","Pranavi ","Kethanaboyina","I have known Pranavi for over 5 years now; she became my best friend very quickly and I have had the privilege of witnessing her incredible growth throughout these last years as well as her many esteemed accomplishments. I have been privy to seeing her overcome each obstacle that stands in the way of her goals and can testify to the purity of the love she carries for humanity. ","5","Pranavi has proved herself to be very capable of working in a team environment. Although many times she holds the role of a director of her team (for example when she was head of the prom committee and when she created a team to put on a TEDx event for the community), she has never been overbearing and prefers to delegate and then step back, allowing her team to come to her if they need input but otherwise allowing them to make decisions in their domain. When she is not holding the main lead role, for example during her time as Treasurer of the Student Government, she was consistent and responsible, going above and beyond to encourage her peers and provide perspectives that may not have been previously considered. She is willing to put the well-being of others over her own pride in order to minimize conflict- a quality she displayed when making decisions as the president of the community service club Interact. ","5","Pranavi is extremely proactive when it comes to communication. Her humility ensures she will never let pride get in the way of asking for help; she always puts others before herself. She is very honest and will seek answers to any questions she may have. She is also very responsible, and will effectively communicate the status of her group to authorities and her peers. ","5","Pranavi has had to face many stressful situations from last minute mishaps and cancellations in events she is in charge of running to having to change her senior project after whole semester of preparation because administration changed their minds. She has never lost her cool or lashed out because of stressful circumstances and time and time again has maintained her composure and acted maturely. ","5","Pranavi has risen to every challenge that has been thrown at her and is very capable at taking charge when the situation calls for it. Being able to be proactive in identifying potential issues ahead of time and finding solutions to those problems are the main reasons she has been so successful in all of her past projects and endeavors.","5","As her best friend, I have gone to Pranavi many times with things that are troubling me. She never tries to talk over me, but rather asks prompting questions to get a full sense of how I am feeling. ","4","Pranavi is very personable and definitely has the ability to be goofy and silly. She does not prefer being stern and will try everything else before having to get to that point, but I have no doubt she will act in accordance to what the situation calls for because she has a lot of experience with guiding elementary school-aged children in science projects. ","3","Pranavi gets energy both from being around people and from being alone- in other words, she is an ambivert. She can hold a high amount of energy for a long duration of time, but she does enjoy her alone time when she can get it. ","I do not. Pranavi started a program where she and one other peer taught a group of fifth graders science projects weekly at a local elementary school as an after-school program her junior year. The program was so successful they were able to spread it to five other schools the next year. I was able to sit in on one of her days of programming and witnessed how she and her partner were able to reign in a group of 30 loud and rowdy fifth graders with gentleness and kindness. ","Pranavi is very passionate about Camp Kesem. She loves the mission of the camp and wants to be able to bring positivity to these kids' lives. She lights up whenever she talks about this opportunity and I believe she would be a great camp counselor. Pranavi has a great passion for the community and above all else, she aims to inspire others. She has an extremely pure hearted and her intentions are never self-centered. I really hope you will give Pranavi the opportunity to be a part of this wonderful cause. ","2018-11-25 16:20:44","public","2018-11-25 18:19:32","public","68.186.53.147","3","1"

emotional disturbances, learning disabilities, other health impairments and/or speech
and language disabilities including children on the autism spectrum.

Kayla has proven to be a dedicated individual who is incredibly caring and thoughtful.
As a volunteer, Kayla has had the opportunity to work with a variety of age groups
including children as young as three years old to students as old as nine years old.
No matter the classroom she is assigned to each day, she embraces the opportunity
to support the students’ development across all domains.

Kayla is often assigned to work one-on-one with specific students or with small
groups. She is calm, patient, and thoughtful, which enables her to build strong
relationships with both staff and students alike. During whole group lessons, Kayla is
able to scan the classroom, identify what needs to be done, and recognize the
students that may need more support in order to participate in the activity
successfully. This skill is innate and highly valued when working with young children.

"44","Lauren","Frost","laurenf3@stanford.edu","9075753532","Edward","Malacon","I worked with Edward throughout the summer of 2018 at Stanford Sierra Camp. We first met a few months prior to summer. We were co-counselors that worked together in the 7-8 year old group.","4","Edward does a fantastic job of taking on the role within the group that needs to be filled. While most of this past summer he filled the role of being the most relatable to the kids (i.e. was very much one of the kids himself), he often stepped up when we were in need of an additional activity and would come up with something creative to do that the kids always LOVED. He was never someone that was overbearing to work with and perfectly toed the line of doing his part while also letting others do theirs. It was an absolute blast working along side of Edward.","3","Edward was always willing to go with the flow of what the group was feeling was best, but also had no problem interjecting if he felt that we could do better. There were many times during the summer that we would have to revise our plans for the kids that day and Edward was always respectful of others' ideas while confidently suggesting ideas of his own. He was never someone that I felt like I couldn't approach or disagree with. Though he comes across as a quieter person that seems to keep to himself, I felt truly cared for by Edward. He's someone who pays attention to the small things and is not afraid to pull you aside at the right time to check on how you are doing. He's really not someone who will outright tell you how he feels unless things are really bad, but he is willing to express how he is doing if asked. He usually worries more about checking on someone else though.","4","Throughout our summer we encountered more than enough kids with behavioral issues, but I was always impressed by how Edward was able to have fun with even the kids that were harder to get along with. What was even more impressive to me was that he had a way of having a serious conversation with kids without dampening the mood or soiling the relationship between him and the child. If there ever was a scenario that was too frustrating or one where he may not have been the best counselor for the job, he had no problem admitting to it and asking one of us for help while keeping his cool the entire time. Never once did I see Edward lose his composure and I don't think I ever will. He always has a calm temperament. I can remember one Friday we had a group of kids that was very difficult to keep engaged and we were starting to lose control of the group. Edward quickly grabbed a stack of paper and some markers and challenged the kids to draw a rocketship, assigning each kid a different task (one kid's rocket had to have a basketball court in it, another's had to have 20 cats in it, etc.). He would then go through each piece one-by-one and joke with the kids and question them on if they successfully completed their task. The kids loved the suspense of seeing if they passed or ""failed"" and his commentary was always hilarious. The activity went so well that we ended up incorporating it every Friday for the rest of the summer!","4","As briefly mentioned before, Edward was always able to step up when the group needed it most. Whether it was coming up with a creative way to entertain restless kids that couldn't sit still, reading to the group in order to keep them calm on a boat ride, or taking on the difficulties that come with a kid that doesn't want to listen, Edward was always there when we needed it most. It was always apparent that he was never stepping up because he wanted to have authority or establish any sort of dominance, it was always for the kids, his fellow counselors, or the entire group.","5","There was one week during the summer that our group of kids was small, but within the group we had a handful of girls that came with some baggage. Two of the girls had been best friends the summer before, but had unfortunately made enemies with a third girl. When they all arrived this summer, however, the third girl apologized and the three of them became a trio of best friends. They seemed to get along really well for a while, but it soon became apparent that the third girl was becoming closer with one of the original two, leaving the other one feeling betrayed and as though she had lost her best friend. There were many tears, but Edward was always there to listen to what the girl had to say and walk her through the steps he felt she should take to help her express to the other girls how they had made her feel. It took a couple of tries, again with many tears in between each attempt, but Edward was always patient and reassuring to her that everything would work out. Eventually, the other girls listened and realized how they had made their friend feel. They quickly made up and not only gained friendships back, but learned valuable lessons in how to handle difficult situations without having to be mean to one another. To a 19 year old the situation may have seemed trivial, but Edward understood how crushing the incident was to an 8 year old and gave her the same care and attention he did to his fellow counselors any time they needed someone to lean on.","5","As I briefly touched on before, Edward's ability to have tough conversations with kids without them walking away feeling hurt was always so cool to witness. He kept things fun and light-hearted and was good at quickly explaining why an action was not okay and then continuing on with the fun. If the unacceptable behavior continued, then he knew when it was time to pull the child aside to have a more serious talk. Even then, when it was assumed there may be some hard feelings felt by the child towards Edward, by the end of the week (or even end of the day) there was never a kid that didn't hate saying goodbye to him. He has a really special way of connecting with kids that so quickly builds their trust, and I think that stems from his desire to be a role model for the kids, rather than establish dominance over them. He never wanted to be a negative person in any of the kids' lives. You could always find him having a blast with the kids and being the first to jump into the lake with them or get into a boat battle.","3","Edward's energy is my favorite trait about him when he is working with kids. Despite his generally calm temperament, his entire aura changes when he is around kids. There was never a moment where you wouldn't find him either running around with the them being one himself or having some meaningful one-on-one time with another. The best part, however, was that it was never forced; he truly loved every moment with the kids and knows that they bring out the best in him. There were days that I knew Edward was coming into the shift not in the best mood or behind on sleep, but you could never see it while he was with the kids because they always brought him the most joy. We had conversations multiple times where he'd end up telling me that he could never stay in a bad mood when he was around the kids because they brought him so much happiness. Away from the kids Edward's energy was much lower, but it was always calming and he was still just as enjoyable and funny to be around.","The only reservation that I could possibly have is that sometimes he has what some may consider to be ""too much"" fun with the kids, where they may feel he is only taking on the fun jobs and avoiding the disciplinary scenarios. What I experienced though was that the impact Edward makes on these kids is always small and meaningful, never flashy. For instance, a situation in which it may appear that Edward is only interacting with one kid may seem easier, but is often a situation in which he's picked out the shyer, quieter kid and is giving them the attention they need to feel more confident.","The relationship Edward forms with kids is one that will warm anybody's heart. As a fellow counselor I couldn't help but be jealous of him at times, because all week the kids would act as though they ""hated"" Edward only to leave the week with it being apparent to everyone that he was their favorite counselor all along. His ability to joke with the kids and somehow carry three at once and never say no to a hug or high five showed these kids day in and day out that he was someone they could trust and look up to. He was so much fun to work alongside and reminded everyone daily of the joys of working with kids just by being himself.

"48","Ali","Sarilgan","sarali19@stanford.edu","4153595537","Sean","Chang","I've known Sean since freshman year as a friend and had the opportunity to staff Arroyo with him in our junior year where I saw how kind, caring and hard-working he is. ","5","Sean is a really empathetic and friendly team player. Even though he was the PHE of Arroyo last year and was paid significantly less than the rest of staff, he took on most of the burden of our team and constantly reached out to other staff members to find ways to best support them. He is a teammate that actively learn how to best support each member of his teams and tailors his friendship/mentorships style to the needs of each person. He was a true pleasure to work with and I have no doubt he'll function effectively in any team he's a part of. ","5","One of the most candid and impactful conversations I had with Sean came last year towards the end of winter quarter where I had been stressed and been slacking off on some of my duties as an RA. He asked to take a walk together, told me all the things he appreciated about me and all the things that he thought I could be doing better in by clearly expressing the impact my inaction has had on him. I left the conversation feeling grateful for his openness and with a clear game plan on things to do/avoid going forward.","5","Towards the end of his freshman year/early sophomore year Sean had some personal issues stemming from his family and was put under immense stress where things seemed to pile up on him. He emerged from that situation incredubly mentally resillient and resourceful. I've seen him support friends with severe mental health issues by giving them his time and energy, responding effectively to one of our residents who went to him to talk about a case of sexual assault and has been a great support to me personally when I talked to him about my parents divorce and my dad's cancer diagnosis. I have full faith that no situation or question will fluster him and he'll be a great mentor to the campers whoa re going through a really hard time in their lives. ","4","I've witnessed Sean be a helpful leader in many different situations. As a PHE managing the dorm community, a SigEp VP delegating tasks for recruitment and as a TA for a math class that I took (talk about a conflict of interest.) In all three of these cases Sean excelled as someone who could think on his feet.
As a PHE he was left alone for three hours during our ski trip to feed 20 hungry frosh where he spontaneously wiped up some hand-made pizza for them.
As a SigEp Recruitment Chair he organized the whole rush process himself and made it run smoothly for over 200 men. 
As a TA when our midterm grades got released during his office hours (they really weren't goog) and everyone started complaining at him, he maintained his cool and took responsibility of the situation.
The only reasons I've ranked a 4 instead of a 5 is that I can't fully imagine the exact responsibilities of a Kesem counselor, and have never seen Sean interact with small kids. But I have no doubt that he can learn fast and respond effectively. ","5","Sean is one of the rare people who can be fully present with someone without inserting his own opinions, crafing his response, being distracted by outside responsibilties and listen intently. Among his friends, he is somone you can go to no matter what your problem is and even though he might not have the best answers will make you fell valid, important and cared about. ","5","If you interview him, you'll quickly see that this man is a 6'4 goofball. Although he can adapt to professional settings and roles of authority extremely quickly, at his heart Sean is really fun, spontaneous and silly, and I think that's precisely what these kids need. I Arroyo he was loved by all our residents as someone fun and goofy that they could play Mariokart with or go eat a dozen donuts at midnight with, but he was also completely comfortable shutting down parties that got out of hand or situations that he deemed unsafe. ","3","Altough he is usually surrounded by friends in energetic group settings, he also thrives one-on-one settings that are quiter. So I don't think he particularly prefers one way or the other and can operate under both settings. ","Absolutely not. He is a very mature child who looks like an adult.

She currently works for me as the Peer Health Educator (dorm staff) in a freshman dorm on campus, Otero House in Wilbur Hall, where I am a resident fellow and her manager.","3","Swetha is easy to have on a team—she has a caring presence, is an excellent listener, and is thoughtful and attentive. She contributes time and effort to our shared tasks and sometimes goes above and beyond the call of duty, both in supporting residents going through tough times by listening and being present for them, and in some shared duties (such as decorating). I wish she were more proactive when dealing with certain situations, and in participating in group meetings.","3","Swetha has been able to clearly communicate her plans for programs and educational events with her co-staff and with the dorm residents. She is also forthcoming and thoughtful when we are conversing about resident issues that need addressing. Generally, I've noticed that Swetha is reserved and quiet and that it helps to prompt her to share her observations with us and the co-staff and to proactively solicit her feedback and viewpoint on topics.","3","So far, I've noticed that Swetha does a great job of staying outwardly calm and composed and supportive with residents who relate difficult situations/crises/troubles; however, from a response standpoint, she has at times been stressed and uncertain of the path forward. Some hand-holding helped us move forward in the right direction. I trust her fully to be mature, calm and caring in challenging moments, but believe some support helps to guide her through next steps.","2","Swetha has not been a leader with respect to volunteering and stepping up for tasks in the dorm so far this year. That said, she has been great about reliably attending staff and house meetings and spending time with residents throughout the week.","5","Listening attentively, patiently and with a caring ear is one of Swetha's greatest strengths. I feel she is a wonderful person to talk with, and has been one of the staff members this year with whom residents are most comfortable sharing confidential, difficult stories/situations. I highly recommend her for such roles.","3","Swetha enjoys people and is easy to be with. She has an easy laugh, a pleasant demeanor, an open ear and a caring heart. Stereotypically, it's easy to picture camp counselors as outgoing and confident, and she doesn't exactly fit that bill, although she can command a room and deliver a message when she needs to. (I thought her group mediation session at a recent house meeting was quite well done!) I have a hard time picturing her playing the authoritarian, but she can certainly be playful and fun.","2","Swetha is clearly social and enjoys people very much. But she is also reserved and seems to need down time to get re-centered.","None whatsoever. I would trust her fully with children.","","2018-11-29 16:22:34","public","2018-11-29 16:56:14","public","171.66.225.137","3","1"

"61","Kady","Richardson","kdrich@stanford.edu","9254514110","A.J.","Aldana","I have known A.J. since March 2017, when we were both hired for a kids group together (Munchkins, ages 3-4) at Stanford Sierra Camp. From there, we spent Spring 2017 meeting weekly to plan educational and fun programming for our kids, and getting to know each other and our two other co-counselors. During Summer of 2017, we spent at least 20 hours a week together for 12 weeks, working together and caring for the current group of kids we were assigned to (guest families stayed for a week at a time and then rotated out). From this experience, I know him extremely well both personally and professionally. We have remained friends since then, and worked together again on the same staff at Stanford Sierra Camp during Summer of 2018 (this time in different job descriptions and not as co-counselors).","5","A.J. is an extremely constructive team member. He is a steady source of affirmation and support for co-workers, and maintains a heavily positive energy throughout a long day of work. I have watched him lead teams of people, and specifically have watched him bring explosive energy to the 3 hour breakfast shift he was in charge of at Stanford Sierra Camp, in which he was managing about 14 people for that period of time. He took a challenging work environment and brought quirkiness and fun each week to that specific shift, and it was noticeable. ","5","A.J. is extremely expressive, and is a very open person. He is a good listener, and consistently uses empathy to relate to others and their point of view. He is willing to listen to feedback, and does not react defensively or rashly. He is not afraid to speak up when he has an opinion, and helps promote accountability with co-workers.","4","A.J. reacts quickly to situations that arise, and is a person who sets much store by his emotions, often leading with his heart. He does this adeptly, however, and would be very good at handling tough situations with children. Furthermore, I believe that his experiences of the past year will equip him to manage any stressful encounter. He spent the Summer of 2018 at Stanford Sierra Camp as a member of the 6 person Ski Dock team, which is responsible for teaching guests (both children and adults) how to waterski and wakeboard. His job was the most safety-focused at camp, and he was exhaustively trained on how to enter situations with safety and care as the foremost priority. Because of this training, and from watching him work, I am extremely confident that he would be able to handle any behavioral challenge with children. Furthermore, the training he has gone through to be a Freshman RA this year has been further reinforcement of how to be a positive and proactive leader.","5","A.J. takes initiative often, and especially can be counted on to bring silliness and energy whenever it is required. His exhaustive supply of energy is unfathomable to me, at times! As his co-counselor, I frequently leaned on him to bring pep to the days when I was having trouble, and could count on him to do his job well. He is very outgoing, and would be especially talented at directing kids' energy positively. Despite his proclivity for loudness, he is also very good at singling out kids who might be a little bit less socially comfortable, and taking time to connect one on one in a quieter manner. He is also generally helpful, and would fit in well with Kesem's environment of collaboration.","5","A.J. has been a sounding board for me since I have known him. I can count on him to listen without judgment whenever I need a listening ear, and he has also been someone who is comfortable taking advice and listening to the perspectives of others. Furthermore, as a Coordinator of Diversity and Inclusion at Sierra Camp this past summer, he spent a great deal of time focusing on issues of identity and opening himself up as a continual resource for co-workers who needed to unload or share their feelings with someone. He performed this role admirably, and was an advocate for whoever needed it.","5","A.J. is CONSTANTLY being silly! Sometimes, he felt like one of the four year olds I was keeping an eye on! He was very good at engaging with the kids we worked with, could belt Moana lyrics with the best of them, and is very in touch with his inner child. A.J. was the person who would most often play Hot Lava Monster with the kids on the playground, and was the best at doing Yoga animal poses with the kids. Despite his competency in being serious and managing challenging behavioral situations when necessary, he first and foremost leads with his personality and his ability to relate to kids.","5","A.J. is a mountain of energy. He can definitely adapt to his environment and is able to enter calm spaces, but he can be counted on to bring the fun if that is desired.","No. I spent 12 weeks as a caregiver for 3 and 4 year olds with him, and had a positive experience with absolutely no mishaps (well, except for a few unavoidable accidents that could be traced back to a previous lack of potty training!) However, those had nothing to do with A.J.'s competency with children :)","As someone who has watched several of her best friends find fulfillment and nourishment from the love and joy of Camp Kesem over the past 4 years, I think that A.J. would benefit extremely from the experience, and would serve the community wonderfully. I wish him all the luck in the world with the process of applying, and guarantee he would be a great choice! ","2018-11-29 18:51:10","public","2018-11-29 19:28:05","public","71.6.63.210","3","1"

George Kingston is one of those students.  Four years ago, George was a student in my Upper Mid AP English class at Hotchkiss, a class in which he consistently maintained an A average. three years ago, George was enrolled in my senior English elective: “The Protest Novel in African American Literature.” I have also known George outside of the classroom, as I was his dormitory faculty in his senior year at Hotchkiss, an independent boarding school for students in grades 9-12.","5","George carries his great character into the classroom where he respects the ideas and opinions of his peers, even when they differ from his own.","5","In the time that I have gotten to know George, I have learned that he is an influential and driven young man inside and outside of the classroom. George was honored with the David Lord Fitzgerald prize here at Hotchkiss after his Lower Middle (10th grade) year. This prize is “awarded annually to who, in the judgment of the faculty, is most notable for his or her positive spirit, strength of character, and compassion for others.” This describes who George is as a constant. I have witnessed George’s compassion, allyship, and empathy during involvement in open meetings and protests held by the Black and Hispanic Student Association in response to the killings of Terence Crutcher and Keith Scott during his time at Hotchkiss.","5","George is never worried about asking for help in stressful situations or keeping his composure. He knows himself well and when he's in ""over his head""--which is rarely ever.","5","George is simply a wonderful young man.  He is confident, humble, intellectually curious, and witty. He is a warm and genuine young man who never boasts his intellect nor hides it. I have honestly never been more proud of one of my students before and George is missed here at Hotchkiss.","5","","5","","5","","I have no reservations about George working with children. George helped me to raise my son during three years of his Hotchkiss experience. My son was 4 years old when his dad and I got divorced. George immediately sought me out when he simply ""saw that Mr. Myers isn't here anymore"" and told me ""I just want you to know that I'm here and would love to help by hanging out with Wallace [my son] whenever I can."" That's the type of person George is; he genuinely wants children to be happy and to help others.","As much as teachers are meant to inspire the students, I have been humbled by George’s incredible character and was often the one on the receiving end of the inspiration. Students like George motivate me to be a better person and teacher. I cannot possibly offer a stronger recommendation for a student to be a part of your camp staff.","2018-12-02 19:43:19","public","2018-12-02 19:57:15","public","67.218.90.4","3","1"

As a teammate, he was Captain of our Varsity Soccer Team beginning in his sophomore year, a role he retained each year after, and he juggled that responsibility with active participation on a competitive club team, as well. He was also one of three student body government leaders at our school, and worked collaboratively to update our dress code, among other things. I was always impressed with how he would empathize and speak for those whose perspectives may not have been his own. He also led the charge in organizing ways for our school to discuss gun violence after Parkland. He is able to work well with peers and adults in the community. Callum has high expectations for himself and is incredibly kind and thoughtful.","5","Again, Callum has enjoyed leadership roles in both the overall school environment and in athletics. He was a phenomenal conduit between his peers and administration. He also cares sincerely about his education and understanding of things. As the top student in his class, he formed outstanding relationships with teachers that supported and advanced not only his own learning, but their understanding of the material, as well. ","5","Callum was always a calm, thoughtful, and balanced presence. He took on the most rigorous academic courseload in this class and managed it with tremendous grace. He was also a soccer referee and wrote a great essay about how angry parents would get with him when he was working a game and made a call against their child. Keeping composure when a grown adult is screaming at you during a game is something he mastered.","5","Callum is a born leader. He's not one to sit back if he can do something to contribute. Anything Callum was involved in was done well and he was never afraid to speak up in any situation. ","5","Callum really values empathy. He wrote his college essay about it, in fact. Further, as a student government chair, there were many voices he was hearing and representing at all times. His work on addressing the discrepancies of our dress code really relied on him being able to articulate the thoughts and concerns of his female classmates, for example, and he navigated that beautifully.","5","For as serious a student as Callum was, he has a tremendous sense of fun. Whether being silly in a class lip sync, or joking in class, Callum was always a delight to be around.","5","Even when Callum was sidelined with a concussion, his energy was apparent. ","Not at all. I wish Callum could spend time with my six year old son every day so his influence could rub off on him. ","I'm including the letter I wrote for his college applications. Callum is the best student and person I have ever worked with. I adore him and hope you will give him every possible consideration. 

I’m just going to cut to the chase. I adore Callum Tresnan. In some dark alley, if an ill word were ever uttered about Callum, as inconceivable a scenario as that is, I would emerge from the shadows like a superhero to defend him. I am passionate about this young man; he is a true intellectual and a deep thinker with a kind heart, a servant’s soul, and a wicked soccer foot. He is humble, thoughtful, appreciative, and responsible. He is sharp, clever, and quick witted. He is also an occasional fretter and an overthinker, and therefore a kindred spirit. Though capable of serious scholarship he, happily, is nevertheless unwilling to take himself too seriously. I offer you my most enthusiastic recommendation for his admission.

Though The Williams School does not officially report rank, rest assured that Callum is first in the most talented class of seniors we have had in at least five years. His English teacher describes him as one of the best students in his career. His academic record is flawless, and he has pursued the most demanding curriculum available to him without question. Callum excels in all academic areas, but he is, above all, our world leader-in-training. He comes by it naturally, after all, as the son of a British father and a Greek-American mother and the grandson of a Foreign Service officer. Callum is an especially skilled social scientist and linguist who aspires to a career in NGOs or the State Department. He earned the rare distinction of pursuing two of our language offerings to their terminal courses, both Spanish and Latin, even earning a “5” on the AP Spanish exam. Callum was therefore a natural choice for one of the select spots in our New London Scholars Program, allowing him the opportunity to take a course, tuition-free, at Connecticut College. Callum will pursue this opportunity in the spring by taking a 300-level Spanish class, building upon his already superlative achievement in the language. In addition to his academic talents, Callum sincerely cares about what’s going on in the world and takes time to learn about the issues affecting different cultures and countries. Ask him about his greatest concern in international affairs and he’ll respond with the situation in Myanmar. And, as leader of our Political and Social Awareness Club, he recently brought in a local attorney to speak at an all-school assembly about immigration issues. He is an avid reader of The Economist who pursues opportunities like Yale Model UN and summer programs through Georgetown and Johns Hopkins CTY because he is hungry for knowledge and eager for challenge. It is therefore more than appropriate that he was the very first recipient of our school’s Intellectual Curiosity Award. This was one of six distinct junior awards presented in May after a faculty vote to replace college book awards with our own, crafted to recognize students who most accurately reflect our mission and educational aspirations. In Callum’s case, it wasn’t whether he would win an award, rather it was which award he should win. 

Callum leads by example and has inspired his peers even as an underclassman. He has been a Varsity Soccer Captain since sophomore year and serves as leader or co-leader of a number of student clubs, from the Foundation for International Medical Relief of Children (FIMRC) to our Service Committee. He also served as Class President for four years until his election and subsequent re-election as one of three Student Body Chairs. As I reflect on Callum’s many leadership roles and extensive engagement within our school, I confess that, on the surface, it seems excessive. Indeed, his impact is felt in every corner of our school, but he attains these positions because he has the trust of his community, and his interests are vast and sincere. Callum is a change maker but in a very quiet and grassroots way. He believes in the power of smaller, more meaningful conversations to affect change; he’s not the loudest in the room but he’s the most prepared and certainly the most collaborative. When Callum talks, students AND faculty listen. As one example, he is currently leading the charge on a student body proposal regarding a more equitable dress code and a cell phone policy that can work for both students and teachers.  And I especially appreciate his generosity with our younger students. Williams is a grade six through twelve school, and I recall seeking out Callum a couple of weeks ago, only to find him sitting at a study carrel outside of the senior lounge surrounded by a posse of eighth grade soccer players eager for his attention. He interacted with them happily and generously, and as I stole him away for our meeting, I realized this was the closest I would ever come to feeling like a celebrity bodyguard. 

I’m compelled to share one additional story before I close. Callum’s English teacher walked into my office not too long ago, tickled by Callum’s audacity. Mr. Kelly was discussing The Tempest, and shared he took issue with Harold Bloom’s interpretation of the Fifth Act. Mr. Kelly mentioned Professor Bloom is just down the road in New Haven, so Callum took the opportunity to email the professor and invite him to class, hoping for a most spectacular literary smackdown. The good professor declined, indicating at 87 years of age, he doesn’t travel anymore. Not one to be denied, Callum has asked if he would welcome the class to visit him at Yale. Stay tuned…

I cannot speak more fondly of this incredible young man whom I have had the pleasure of knowing these last six years. The Williams School has graduated its fair share of academic powerhouses and incredible human beings, but Callum embodies the two in a way that is truly extraordinary. I was especially impressed with how he navigated the aftermath of a concussion from a soccer game that affected him throughout the entirety of his junior year. His hopes to be recruited to play collegiate soccer fell to the wayside as he was unable to once again compete in contact sports until this past summer. Initially, he was not himself, and I know he faced enormous frustration at times, but I also know he learned a great deal about himself along the way. The fact that he maintained his academic record and extracurricular impact is just amazing.  Indeed, I am exceedingly proud of the human being and scholar he has become. He has taken the opportunities afforded to him at Williams and squeezed every drop from them, while giving back even more. I admire the faculty influence he welcomes into his life, building strong relationships and stealing inspiration. I smile when I think about Callum and the black notebook he keeps on his nightstand, a habit he took from his favorite English teacher; it serves as a simple device for breaking down complex ideas he reads about or vocabulary he comes across that he does not know and needs to look up. He is always learning. Whenever I spend time with Callum I think about my five-year old son and how much I hope the world will inspire and fascinate him in the same way it has Callum. I recommend him wholeheartedly for admission and hope you will give him the closest consideration.

Sincerely, 
Cristan Harris

"94","Nathaniel","Guevin","nz.guevin14@gmail.com","6178958744","Sydney","Brown","Sydney and I are both counselors at Beaver Summer Camp. This past summer I was her head counselor. I have known Sydney for many years but we have worked directly together for the past two. ","5","Sydney is a tremendous team player. She has been for as long as I have known her. This past summer I never felt that she was having a hard time being a part of our small team, nor the larger team that was the counselors for our age group. She cared deeply about ensuring fairness for all counselors and campers alike. She is someone who is incredibly easy to get along with. ","5","There was never a moment this summer where I did not know what Sydney needed from me. She was open to asking questions and to making small mistakes in order to learn. She also was very willing to receive feedback on things that she had done at any time. ","5","Sydney was always composed and capable of getting her job done in the moment, no matter the external stressors. ","5","I firmly believe that this is one area where Sydney shines through more than most people her age. She knows when to take charge and when to take a step back and allow someone else to. I believe she is far more equipped in this field than most. ","5","Sydney is an excellent listener both to faculty and campers. She was always someone who I felt as though I could vent to after a difficult experience, and she was open to giving feedback. I saw this with the campers as well. ","5","Sydney represents a fantastic mix of serious and silly in my eyes. She can redirect behavior while reinforcing others, and can certainly make just about anybody laugh. I have seen Sydney dress up as a zebra, and I have seen Sydney have very serious conversations about behavior, and she is at home in both situations. ","3","I ranked Sydney a 3 in this question because she has such a dynamic range for children. She is recharged by both quiet and social environments, and I have seen her thrive in both. She is a human who can be playing soccer at full energy one moment, and reading a book quietly to a child who needs a break the next. I have never seen her opt out of an activity due to a lack of energy for said activity, regardless the level needed. ","Not at all. ","Sydney Brown is an absolute pleasure to work with. I genuinely feel as though I learned as much from her this past summer as she did from me. She is someone I would entrust with any task, no matter how large. Sydney never ceases to impress me as a human being, and as a counselor, and any camp would be lucky to have her on their staff.

"96","Gara","Johnson-West","gjohnsonwest@sjs.org","7138055308","Camille","Dawson","I have known Camille since she was a little girl.  Her big sister, Catherine, was a student first in my sophomore history class and then in my senior government course.  Catherine began babysitting for my young daughters, and as she did so, our families grew closer together.  Eventually, my girls were spending time at her house, and Catherine, and her sisters, Christie and Camille, did the same at mine.  In what seems like no time at all, Camille was a student in my sophomore history class and then a senior in my seminar on Revolutions and revolutionary theory.  ","5","Camille is a joy in every sense of the word.  She is kind, encouraging, and thoughtful - all traits that make her an ideal member of the team.  In my sophomore history class, I had numerous groups and cliques represented, but it was Camille and her upbeat and warm personality that brought everyone together.  ","5","Camille cares deeply about other people, and as a result, she strives to work with them to achieve the best possible outcome.  I saw her engage in this manner as a student and as a prefect at St. John's.  ","5","I have known Camille for the majority of her life, and I have never once seen her lose her composure.  Even when sad or stressed, she expresses her emotions in a genuine and positive way.  And, to be fair, Camille has gone through a great deal, especially recently with her father's heart transplant.  Throughout the duration of the crisis, she has demonstrated nothing but grace and maturity.  ","5","Camille is certainly accustomed to having ""many irons in the fire.""  At St. John's, she was an officer in WHEE (Women Helping to Empower Each other), our female affinity group, a student leader, a cheerleader, and an academic all star.  She balanced her numerous time commitments with aplomb and skill.  She is a leader by nature, and I have no doubt that she will manage her responsibilities with care and ease.  ","5","Camille is so incredibly good hearted.  As a result, she was the sounding board, advice columnist, and psychologist for many a peer and occasionally even adults.  She cares deeply for others and consistently strives to be present with each and every individual she encounters. ","5","Camille is above all, fun, playful, and easy to be around!  She will engage with campers in a meaningful, positive, and upbeat way, as she does with everyone around her.  ","4","","Absolutely not.  She spent a great deal of time with my own children when she lived in Houston.  ","Camille is a genuinely incredible young woman.  She is brilliant, kind, caring, funny, and inherently good.  I cannot imagine a more perfect candidate for this opportunity.  She knows what it is like to be the child of a sick/ailing parent, and I love that she is striving to share her heart and time with others in the same situation.  And, I have to say, it doesn't surprise me in the least.","2018-12-03 13:32:21","public","2018-12-03 14:02:22","public","216.227.243.167","3","1"

"100","Susan","Hanberry","susan.hanberry@stratford.org","4787475285","Tejas","Athni","I have known Tejas for eight years.  I taught him biology, sustainable design, coached him in quiz bowl, and was his research mentor.  Tejas and I attended many science competitions together.  I was able to observe how he handled new situations where he did not know anyone.  l have watched Tejas as he made presentations to large and small groups and while he taught CPR to younger students at school.","5","I taught Tejas in design for 3 years.  During this time he worked collaboratively in a number of different groups with other students.  He always did his part and then some.  He has a pleasant personality and does not need to be the center of attention.  He listens well and will add comments, but he does not have to have the last word.  ","5","Tejas worked effectively in groups as noted above because he communicates well.  When we attended science competitions together I was able to watch him meet new people, for new friends and include others in his new community.  It was pretty amazing to watch.  He is a fairly quiet young man, but he dove right into new situations and was an integral part for forming a new community.  This requires great communication skills as well as good listening skills.","5","I have watched Tejas handle stress from several different sources.  He has done a number of presentations at science competitions and at his TED x talk.  He was able to define what was causing him stress and address that particular piece of the problem.  By responding this way, he did not have a sense of global stress that he felt unable to handle.  He is pretty self-aware about how to approach stress logically.  I also watched him with his friends at school, and he was able to defuse some of the teen drama that was going on around him.  He is not quick to panic nor is he quick to get angry.","5","Tejas has always been a responsible young man.  Design class requires students to take a part of the assignment and see it through.  He has always stepped up to do his part, and also help others.  ","5","Tejas listens well in groups and with individuals.  I had a small group of students in his class who would stay after school and talk about many things - science, politics, personal issues - and Tejas contributed to these conversations, but was also a very good listener.  He did not hear what he wanted to hear, but he listened to what the others were saying.","5","Tejas did a great job when he taught CPR to our students.  He asked them questions and was able to really engage them in the process.  He can be very silly as well.  He likes to dance.  When he was in quiz bowl, I drove the bus and he and his team mates yelled out the window at every stop light, ""Help!  We've been abducted.""  He and his friends have their own set of silly comments and have always taken shared experiences to add to this group language.  I have always found that students who are able to do this are the ones who relate best to others.","2","Tejas is a social person and has many close friends, but he is more on the calm end of the spectrum.  By no means is he reclusive, however.  ","None whatsoever.  ","I am sure Tejas would be a great counselor!","2018-12-03 16:53:06","public","2018-12-03 17:55:22","public","104.6.145.74","3","1"

"110","Rebecca","Potter","rebecca.potter@txkisd.net","9038240680","Eleanor","Schroeder","I have known Eleanor since she was a young girl as I have a daughter about her age, and they attended the same school. For her last three years of high school, Eleanor was a member of the high school newspaper staff that I advise. For two of those years, she served as an editor. I have spent many late nights working on the newspaper with her and have had the opportunity to see her perform in many stressful situations.","5","There's a saying that a group is only as strong as its weakest link. The high school newspaper that Eleanor worked on was a team with members at various different abilities. During her senior year, Eleanor was the editor-in-chief of a staff of about 50. She oversaw beginning writers who had little experience and other editors who had been in the program for three years. During some of the most stressful moments, I observed Eleanor be a team motivator, decision-maker and teacher. It was her responsibility to make sure that everyone was able to complete their tasks so that deadlines were met. At times, she was out front as the leader, and at other times, she was with the rest of the staff doing the ""work that had to be done.""","5","Eleanor is a communicator. As editor of the school newspaper, she had to lead our daily staff meetings where she instructed staffers on what needed to be done and got feedback from them on ways that she could help. Not only did she had to communicate effectively with the staff, she often had to meet with the school principal about matters that related to scholastic journalism. ","5","I've seen Eleanor is many stressful situations, from the pressure of meeting deadlines when others haven't met their responsibilities to meeting with authority figures on controversial issues. When observing Eleanor in these situations, it’s clear that she is a thoughtful and deliberative decision maker who weighs her options and bases her actions on the greater good. Eleanor understands that her reactions in tough situation have the power to make an impact on those around her.","5","Eleanor will fit right in. As far as high school is concerned, there aren't too many more hectic situations than being in the newspaper classroom. Everyone is doing something different, no one agrees on anything, and the school community is often critical of their work. I've seen Eleanor handle this with grace. When something didn't go as planned, Eleanor didn't waste time complaining, rather instead, she became a problem-solver. ","5","When a series of tragedies hit our school (the death of a student and the attempted suicide of another), Eleanor and the rest of the editorial staff listened to the student body. People were hurting. So she and other editors formed a plan that brought the school together and addressed some tougher issues teenagers face. They delved into topics that are often considered taboo in the high school setting. I've witnessed Eleanor lead a newsroom discussion to examine the merits of an issue and I've seen her sit back and listen while analyzing what others are saying.","5","Eleanor is one of the most well-rounded individuals I have encountered. She can modify and adjust to just about any situation she is faced with. She can be authoritative when someone needs to be corrected; she can be compassionate when someone needs a shoulder to lean on; she can be inspiring when someone needs encouragement. She had to demonstrate this ability while working on the newspaper staff. ","5","She shows passion in all her activities and takes her endeavors seriously. When Eleanor began her year as editor-in-chief, she read a series of letters she had written to the staff, one for each grade level. She talked about responsibility, of creating something to be proud of, and of being a source of encouragement. Eleanor set the tone for the year. Even though she expects a lot from others, she demands even more of herself. I image that she will put forth the same level of determination to this camp. She will give it her all--whatever energy level that each situation requires.","No reservations whatsoever.","Eleanor is an exceptional young lady who cares deeply about others, and she is willing to put her actions into it. In my experience working with high school students, I see many who are ""a lot of talk,"" seldom putting in the effort to make a difference. Eleanor isn't one of these people. I have no doubt that she will have a positive impact on the lives of the campers at Camp Kesem. ","2018-12-04 06:08:34","public","2018-12-04 06:57:08","public","69.30.153.250","3","1"

I taught her as a freshman in my English class from 2013-2014, and she was part of a group of students I led on a service trip in Bolivia in 2016.","5","Camille was part of a group of students who traveled with me to work at an orphanage in Cochabamba Bolivia in the summer of 2016. Camille was an amazing team member. She helped others when they were down, helped set a leadership role, and shared her experiences with the team to inspire everyone.","5","I remember an instance in which one of the other team members (younger than Camille) was having difficulty following the trip's social media policy. Camille met with her privately and helped her understand the importance of adhering to the policy in a way that was empathetic and effective.","5","Traveling to a developing country comes with many challenges for adolescents from developed countries. Camille took all of these--poverty up-close, gastro-intestinal issues, different climate/sounds/smells, etc.--in stride. She likes adventure and thrives with it.","5","Camille has a great sense of calm in the storm. She handles hectic situations with a steady hand.","5","Camille is easy approachable and respected by her peers. They trust her.","5","I can totally imagine Camille being appropriately goofy and silly. She has a great sense of humor and doesn't take herself too seriously.","4","","no","Even as a freshman, Camille glowed with effervescence and enthusiasm, and she had a way of making her peers around her feel at ease and at home.

"112","Chris","Thomas","chris007@stanford.edu","2817348202","Olivia","Flournoy","Olivia has worked for the Stanford Competitive Sports program for the past year as an official, scorekeeper, and event assistant. During that year, she has worked flag football, basketball, soccer, and volleyball. She shows up to every shift with a smile and an infectiously positive attitude. She came into the position without knowledge in any of those sports but wanted to push herself out of her comfort zone, and has excelled every step of the way. She is not afraid to ask questions if she is unsure about something but also has the confidence to handle stressful situations on her own. I would highly recommend her for this position as I know she will exceed any and all of your expectations.","5","We have a staff of about 20 students and contingent workers, and Olivia is able to work with everyone on staff. She has been constantly praised by participants and fellow staff members as someone who is easy to approach, fair, and willing to go the extra mile. She is the example I use with my staff on how to work as a team player. She is comfortable in a leadership role but can also take a backseat to other leaders and contribute as a facilitator and someone who will hold others accountable.","4","Every young official has to learn how to communicate efficiently and effectively in high stress situations. Olivia has shown a lot of growth in this area, especially in sports that she is not comfortable with. She has a very inviting personality and remains calm during conflicts, which is not something that can be easily taught. She will continue to grow in this area as she becomes more comfortable with herself and the environments we put her in.","4","Olivia grew up officiating youth softball, which as a fellow youth/high school official, I can say is the most stressful sport to officiate. She remains calm and has the keen ability to defuse situations well before they reach their boiling point. Her confidence has continued to build as she has worked other sports. There are very few, if any, situations that she cannot already handle on her own.","4","Olivia has been placed in situations that require her to think on her feet or operate in grey areas, as they are very prevalent in the sports world. While she would prefer have direct guidance in those situations, as I think most people would, she is more than capable of coming up with a creative solution and justifying why she came up with it. She worked a very large soccer tournament with me at the beginning of the year and I left her in charge of the entire registration with little-to-no instructions, wanting to see how she would organize that process. She exceeded even my very high expectations and the entire tournament benefited from the processes she created to sign teams in and get them to their respective fields.","5","A key part to listening is understanding the reason behind the question/concern and addressing both the question and the reason behind the question. Olivia has developed that skill over years of officiating, as many complaints or questions about rules have hidden meanings or agendas from the players/coaches. Olivia asks a lot of deep questions regarding why certain rules or policies are in place so that when these situations arise, she can not only address the question directly but also provide the why behind it.","5","Olivia would be the perfect camp counselor. I have worked with camps in a variety of different fields and I would take Olivia over most, if not all, of the other counselors I have had work for me in the past. While I have not seen her interact with youth, I know her personality with our intramural participants and fellow staff members would make her an instant favorite among the campers. She knows how to enforce the rules while still having fun, which is what I want from all of my intramural officials. Safety and fun are two of our fundamental pillars here, and Olivia embodies both of those without even trying.","5","High, positive energy. That is Olivia. The soccer tournament we worked was on a very warm day in September and we were out there for about 8 hours. Olivia's attitude did not waiver at all that day. When she is passionate about something, which I picked up on when she approached me about this camp, she will work with such a high level of energy that it is impossible to not try and match her energy throughout the day.","My only reservation with Olivia is that she often tries to put too much on her plate at once, as she wants to help out in as many ways as she can. We have worked on this together and I have told her that it is OK to say no, something I often struggle with too. It took a few months of working with her to realize that she needed to be told this, so I would sit down with her before camp started and let her know that she can say no to certain things so she does not feel over stressed at all.","Olivia is an amazing employee who continues to exceed the expectations that I set for her as well as the ones she sets for herself. I would highly recommend her for this position. Please feel free to contact me should you have any other questions!","2018-12-04 10:28:24","public","2018-12-04 10:58:31","public","171.66.209.4","3","1"

My wife and I are Resident Fellows (RF’s) at Stanford, and we selected Krishna as one of our top 6 choices from a pool of nearly 200 applicants that wanted to be staff members in our community. (I’d also like to share, if it helps you weigh my evaluation of Krishna, that in my professional life, I am a psychologist and therapist, as well as being a former director of spiritual care at a hospice in San Diego and former director of a marriage and family therapy graduate program. I care very deeply about others relating compassionately, genuinely, and skillfully to those who are hurting and who have lost loved ones.)","5","Krishna is innovative, bright, creative, inclusive, flexible, and pragmatic-- he sees solutions others might not consider that raise the collective positive impact of the group. He values equity in sharing the work and is able to clearly offer his perspectives on student life, as well as his own. ","5","He would be an excellent peer in communication: thoughtful, respectful, kind, reflective, aware of his impact on others and curious about their experiences of being at camp, wanting to build meaningful connection, appreciating both similarities and differences, supportive in the hard times, receptive to feedback, and wanting the best for all.","5","Being a Stanford student is inherently stressful, and Krishna navigates that reality with realness and transparency. He is honest about his struggles and reaches out for help when needed. He also owns his strengths accurately and understands how to use them to help him keep perspective. Krishna is incredibly well liked in the dorm, and is approached continuously as a person seen as safe and helpful with difficult content in students lives (e.g., relationships, discerning life choices, making fiends, being lonely, acute anxiety, missing home, etc.)","5","Please see my answer above. Krishna will excel at this wholeheartedly. He is willing to carry his weight and values equity in the sharing of tasks. This will be a strength of his, you can count on him jumping in.","5","Please see my above answer, Krishna is literally sought out in our community in real time, right now, as someone students feel comfortable confiding in on a range of vulnerable topics. He is non-judgmental, open, warm, receptive, and generous with his time.","5","Krishna is goofy too, fun, lighthearted, wanting to have fun, would run round with the kids, laugh with them, engage them in games, be physically active, playful...he does that with the students here and that's a crucial part of what they trust him. I can see kids really having fun with him and that creating a doorway to depth and more meaningful connection.","3","Krishna is honestly a mix in my experience. He can sit quietly and be at peace. He is also at home with this friends in larger groups. He can hang 1:1, he can chill with a large group of students in his room. The rigors of being a Stanford college student require shifting between introversion and extroversion depending on context, as does his student-centric approach of being a staff member in our frosh community. He would desire to meet campers where they are and go from there, while at the same time be able to help adjust a campers energy level either way if that was an appropriate thing to do in your all's estimation. ","None at all.","Living within a community of Freshman as a leader is a challenging task, Krishna excels at celebrating residents in their moments of joy, success, and accomplishment, as well being with them in their insecurities, hardships, and losses.","2018-12-04 14:17:51","public","2018-12-04 14:44:25","public","128.12.255.4","3","1"

He soon after became a mentee of mine and we have kept in touch throughout his high school and recent college education.  ","5","Kevin is great with communication and working on a team.  I personally witnessed his communication with families while he was a volunteer at the children's hospital.  He seamlessly is able to calm toddlers while helping lost parents navigate the hospital system.  Working as a hospital volunteer required communication with other volunteers because of their high demand and integral position.  He explained to me that he would often take other's people's shifts when others could no make it. I think he would have no issue working with fellow counselors in pursuit of a great camp experience and being able to take criticism need-be. ","5","As stated above, Kevin is very open with peers both in a fun and professional level.  As his mentor, he is prompt to meetings with me and has never been late.  I feel that he doesn't lack in a communication stand point. ","4","The closest thing I've witnessed to stressful situations is scared and stressed parents yelling at volunteers because they needed someone to take their anger out on.  I saw Kevin handle a situation like this once, and he remained very calm and got a superior involved right away.  Exactly what he should've done. ","5","What may seem simple to others is when Kevin took charge of the snow cone stand at the children's hospital.  This is a task given to the junior volunteers, but when they failed to show up to their shifts, Kevin took the ice machine and flavored syrups with a smile.  It's these little examples of deeds that truly personify Kevin's willingness to lead another team and help an overall mission go smoothly.","5","As a mentor, I can say confidently that Kevin is a great listener.  He would also no doubt be able to hear out the concerns of children and fellow counselors. ","5","I know that Kevin would be able to adapt to the introverted children and help to mitigate their initial comfort in the camp.  He would also be able to handle the wild child bunch and keep them entertained.  Working side by side with him in the hospital, we also work with an endless number of personalities and I can confidently state that he is able to adapt to the personalities he works with. ","3","I put a 3 on this question because as stated in the previous question, Kevin is adaptable.  He's always making me laugh as an extremely extroverted individual.  I have seen him calm crying children (a common occurence at camp) and play games with energetic children children when parents need a break.  If I had to make a best guess, I'd describe him as an extroverted introvert.  Still needs his space at times, but always fun when around. ","None! He was great at the children's hospital and loves working with kids. ","As a fellow Camp Kesem counselor myself: Luigi - University of Texas at Austin Chapter, I have no doubt that Kevin would make a great addition to the Kesem family and help the kids at camp have a great time.

"132","Alivia","Shorter","ashorter@stanford.edu","8315216971","Noah Jordan","Magbual","I came to know Noah when he served as a residential counselor for the Stanford Medical Youth Science Program (SMYSP), Summer of 2018. I have known Noah for 1 year now, and served as a supervisor as well as instructor for the course Medicine1A: Leadership in Multicultural Health. 

This program has served nearly 700 low income high students over the last 30 years through an intensive summer residential program that provides academic enrichment and mentorship. SMYSP seeks to inspire, empower, and prepare students from disadvantaged and underrepresented backgrounds to pursue college, excel in health sciences, and become the next generation of diverse professionals and leaders in the field of medicine and in their communities. The Residential Counselor position is a vital member of the team, and lives with, supervises, mentors, teaches, and ensures the safety of the high school students who participate. ","5","Similar to Camp Kesem, the SMYSP program depends on strong team work among the residential staff, to ensure that our students have a safe, positive experience. Noah worked alongside 9 other Stanford undergraduates over the 5-week residential program; he received praise and recognition from his fellow counselors, including Head Counselor/Program Manager, on his ability to work both independently on his responsibilities and duties, but also as a cohesive unit. In this role he was paired with two other undergraduates to coordinate study session and academic support programming for the students, developed fun games and activities to reinforce learning, and to work as a unit throughout the summer. I observed Noah bring great energy and excitement to the team dynamic, and also delivered on his tasks in a timely manner.","5","I have no concerns regarding Noah's communication skills and ability to interact with a team. Noah was a very enthusiastic, passionate, and empathetic team member in our program, an energy that builds confidence with his peers, and makes it incredibly easy to open up to him for thoughtful conversation. Each week I met with the staff for check-ins, and observed Noah reflect on his experience in the program, communicate that with the team, and myself, and more importantly listen to others when they needed help. While we often think about effective communication in team work, effective and empathetic listening is just as important, a strength Noah also possesses.","4","I have not observed Noah react negatively, or excessively emotionally, in response to any student issues. Throughout my observation of him, he remained composed at all times, maintained his authority and rapport. I would have no concern with hiring Noah again for a residential counselor role for my program, or others. The program can be stressful, however, due to the day-round responsibilities and high volume of duties. Despite this, Noah always stayed positive, communicated when he was experiencing a higher-than-usual level of stress, and delivered on his projects with the help and support of his team. His head counselor has since recommended that he work for our program again in the future, because he was such a strong asset to the team. ","5","Noah is very much a team player, who is willing to go above and beyond his duties. One example of this was Noah’s energy and enthusiasm to take on an additional project at the end of the program. For the program closing ceremony/graduation, Noah stepped up and offered to create a video slideshow, capturing the summer program. This was a beautiful ending to the summer, and would not have happened without Noah’s enthusiasm and willingness to step and take the lead. ","5","The SMYSP program welcomes students from low-income and underrepresented backgrounds, and many students have experienced high levels of adversity in their lives. We not only support their academic growth, but their personal and leadership development as well. The program asks counselors to lead and facilitate community conversations and workshops on topics such as identity, advocacy, power and privilege. In order to be effective in this role, Noah was not only expected to become familiar with the content, but to listen to students, foster their exploration, and maintain a safe environment. Noah built strong rapport with his students because he listened, made sure they felt heard, and earned their trust. Noah developed a workshop around self-care for the students, which speaks to his compassion and ability to listen to their needs. ","5","I have no concern about Noah’s ability to engage with the students—I observed him build close relationships with not only the staff but also his students. He brought his own interests in dance, theater, and music to the program; on many occasions I observed Noah singing along and asking the students about their own music interests during clean-up periods; they undoubtedly appreciated his light-hearted energy during chore times. ","5","Noah is a thoughtful, reflective, and compassionate team member who draws on his own identity, lived experience, and culture as a source of strength. This practice allows him to connect with many people and more importantly break down walls and barriers. In SMYSP we believe in “meeting students where they are” and recognizing that we need not only listen to the loudest voices, or assume that the quieter ones are simply shy.                  ","None at all ","Noah is unquestionably an exceptional candidate for Camp Kesem, I cannot recommend him enough! I hope to work with him again in a future summer.

"133","Amy","Welshhans","amyewelshhans@gmail.com","3307195236","Ellie","Utter","I have know Ellie for approximately two years. We met as fellow staff members for an international peace camp through an organization called CISV. Even though Ellie was technically a junior staff, she showed amazing maturity and flexibility. Being on staff often means being at a crushing pace for 18 hours each day for a period of four weeks. No matter the amount of time and energy required, Ellie never wavered in her exemplary levels of compassion, kindness and infectious positive nature. She was able to easily flow between relating to and leading our 11-year-old participants, 16-year-old junior counselors and adult leaders.","5","In working with Ellie as a staff member at a four-week camp, I quickly learned that she was someone who would ensure that every member on the team was supported. She also had a knack for knowing where her fellow teammates needed help and seamlessly inputting extra effort to fill any gaps. Ellie also truly brings joy to her fellow teammates in a way that keeps morale high even when the stress levels are high. She cares about each person she works with and will do her best to help the entire team succeed without any need for individual recognition.","5","In our camp we had countless situations arise that required quick thinking, action, and flexibility. Throughout each incidence, our staff needed to maintain fluid and constant honest communication. Ellie proved amazing maturity and self-awareness in being able to keep constant communication with her fellow staff members. She was able to communicate on information that was pertinent to each situation, and also was able to communicate on an emotional level. When she saw another staff member struggling, she was able to reach out and provide compassion to those who struggled to share their emotions. She also was able to share when she was reaching a point of overwhelm and asked for what she needed in order to jump back in.","5","Ellie showed an exemplary level of composure and maturity when dealing with the numerous stressful situations that arose during our camp. I never once saw her lose her composure with a camper, leader, nor fellow staff member. She always remained calm and provided respect, comfort, and kindness whether it was dealing with a child who was mistreating other delegates, a junior staff member who was in the wrong but also misunderstood, or adult leaders who were angry and venting it a disrespectful manner. ","5","Going into the camp I staffed with Ellie, I was the person with the most experience in our position. Due to my experience, I was often performing many duties and weighing in on many decisions. There were numerous times where I was approaching the point of overwhelm, and suddenly Ellie appeared and was either assisting with the task I needed help with or asking how she could help. No matter what the job was she was ready and willing to jump in because she knew that initiative would accomplish the goals we had for the camp and would support her teammates. We also have an overwhelming number of moving parts in a CISV camp, and Ellie beautifully maneuvered the jobs that were part of her role while also absorbing tasks of others who needed to take care of a situation that arose.","5","We had a junior counselor who had found himself in a defensive position regarding behavior towards another junior counselor. Both were in the wrong, but initially it was portrayed that he was clearly in the wrong. The initial person that he wanted to talk to was Ellie because he knew that she would hear him and be fair. Ellie then reached out to the right people and the situation was able to be solved at the right levels. But without the trust that the junior counselor had in Ellie, the first steps to the process may have never taken place. Ellie has a gift of being completely present for people when she is listening to them. The kids also sought her out constantly because they knew she cared about them by the way she listened to them. As a teacher I truly believe that kids know who are genuinely listening to them and who is not. Every kid at our camp was magnetically drawn to Ellie because they knew she cared through how she listened to them.","5","Another element of why the kids at our camp were drawn to Ellie was her willingness to be silly and goofy. As an international camp with 11-year-olds, that often means low levels of English proficiency. However, one thing that is the same in every language and breaks the ice is laughter. Ellie could always be counted on to get a smile and create fun that other kids wanted to be a part of. We also have a good amount of heavy moments at camp where tears and anger are flowing and the adults need to help the kids mediate their own feelings as well as how their feelings interact with others. Ellie always sat through the uncomfortable situations with kids helping them navigate their way through the conflict to find a resolution that all felt was respectful and kind. She also was able to step into a discipline situation regarding a camper. She did a great job of maintaining the demeanor that showed the expectation of better behavior, without showing disrespect to the camper. ","4","I would say Ellie is incredibly high energy most of the time, but also knows how to exude calm when we needed to change the energy of the camp to a level of calm such as lullabies before bed. Ellie like every other human, occasionally needs calm to maintain balance. However, I would say Ellie functions at a high level of energy, especially within the group setting.","I have absolutely no reservations about Ellie working with children. ","Truly, Ellie is someone that the kids at your camp need to have there. I would choose to work with her at a camp in a heartbeat and know that she will be an asset to her fellow counselors. As a teacher, I also can see when someone has a gift for working with children. Her compassion, positivity, caring, and depth makes her someone that kids respect and seek out for fun, as well as comfort.

"134","LAKSHMI","IYER","iyerLs@appstate.edu","3362541190","Sarayu","Pai","I have known Sarayu for almost 10 years in various capacities. As a Triad Indian Community member, as her teacher at a summer camp I ran  (she participated for 2 years) and then as a mentor for about 3 years, when she served as a near-peer mentor for the same week-long camp.","5","Sarayu is a very mature, compassionate and likeable girl. I have observed her over the years and am always very impressed with how well she works with her team mates and.or with kids when she served as a volunteer/program leader. She is  a natural leader and is a very reliable person.","5","In the IT is for Girls camp I directed (wiit.uncg.edu) while at UNC Greensboro, the program leaders had to work with each other to ensure there is coordination of events and sharing of resources. Following the sequence of events was very critical to ensure the days plans were not off. Sarayu was always on target, ending her sessions on time, ensure all the computers/robotics items were packed and safely stored away for next days use. We usually have reflection activities to see what went well and identify areas for improvement. Sarayu was always very candid in her comments and in a way that was well thought out. The focus was on improving the process and outcome but not to be critical for the sake of being critical. ","5","I have seen Sarayu be extremely mature and composed at the most difficult situation one can have. She was by the side of her father in the Gym when he suddenly collapsed and passed away within a short period of time. Her mother was in India at that time. Sarayu was home with her younger brother and paternal grandfather. Her mom requested Sarayu not to divulge the information about her dad's passing as she was afraid at how her younger sibling and the older grandad would handle it. Despite the sorrow and stress she faced, Sarayu held the fort at home and ensured her mom that she would manage until she got back. No child that young has to go through this. It was incredible to see Sarayu be so brave and composed in such a difficult situation. There is absolutely no doubt in my mind about her ability to handle stressful situations.","5","Sarayu served as a program leader for Robotics session in the week long summer camp for two consecutive years. She was always proactive in getting all of the necessary equipment for the session and was very responsible in ensuring the same was returned every evening. Just prior to one of the final presentations; one of the student's robotic control unit stopped working and the campers were panicking. Sarayu took the initiative to contact other robotic clubs in the area and secured an unit that ensure the campers were able to finish their prototype /demonstration. This illustrates her ability to think on her feet and help solve the problem. I am very confident in entrusting her with responsibilities.","5","Sarayu is a great listener. Again, for the robotics session, the campers are to discuss ways in which they can create prototypes to demonstrate how robots can help address social problems. I have observed Sarayu lead discussions on this and encourage her campers to come up with innovative ideas. She encourages others to voice their opinions and embellish their ideas without taking over. ","5","Again, I have seen Sarayu not only interact with the campers during her session but also during breaks and lunch. I think she has a very friendly and down-to-earth attitude that young students will find appealing. I am sure she will be a great asset to engage with the campers.","5","I have seen Sarayu work with passion to realize her dreams. She is an extremely hard working student and has handled very difficult situations. The campers that she has dealt with are middle school kids who have very high level energy and of different personalities. I did not see any concern with her ability to handle the diverse group of campers.","I have absolutely no reservations in recommending Sarayu for this role. ","I am very confident Sarayu will be a perfect counselor for this camp. Her experience as a program leader for the summer where she worked with young middle school girls has prepared her well to be a great counselor. She has grown pretty strong through her own personal experiences. I think she will be a great fit and asset to this program.

We met at Stanford Sierra Camp and worked on a four person team throughout the spring and summer of 2019 to design and carry out outdoor educative programming for 3 and 4 year olds at Stanford Sierra Camp.","5","Michelle is the most dedicated and adaptable team member I have ever had the pleasure to work with.  Michelle and I worked on a four person team throughout the spring and summer as counselors for three and four year olds, and though each week we went through the same routine, she never failed to ask ""how could I have better supported you today?""  Michelle created space for our group to reflect and more intimately understand each other's needs in our workspace, and she is more than willing to follow through with implementing changes that team members suggest. ","5","Michelle has an outstanding capacity to make those she works with feel valued in all group decision making processes.  One of our co-counselors had to go home early in the summer for a health issue, and Michelle turned what could have been a very contentious and isolating situation into a struggle experienced together by bringing the remaining team together and facilitating a conversation to decide how to approach management about the team changes.  Michelle is also able to give very constructive and honest feedback when someone's behavior is not working for the team.  When I left with a child without telling my other team members, Michelle took the initiative to ask me to communicate more explicitly.  She approached this conversation very seriously and thoughtfully, and our team moved on without any tension or animosity afterwards.","4","Michelle embraces all of the rich emotion of everyone she interacts with.  I would say that she moves toward the very same raw and terrifying emotional situations that would break other's composure.  It is difficult to have a mundane or guarded conversation with Michelle; she is always able to guide the topic towards the intense.  She was an incredible worker and a trusted confidant for many on staff all the while managing a traumatic family situation at home.  I have no doubt that Michelle will demonstrate exceptional strength and composure at Kesem.","5","Michelle does not hesitate to do what needs to be done for the group or to go above and beyond for her teammates.  Michelle took initiative each week to further enhance our programming for the children, taking it upon herself to design new treasure hunts, craft new mysteries, or even plan elaborate surprise appreciations of fellow co-counselors.","5","Michelle has an incredible inclination and ability to listen.  It is difficult to pick one example for elaboration, actually, because this is a part of her everyday self!  Perhaps the most ongoing and powerful demonstration of her listening ability was with our co-counselor who had to leave in seek of medical attention at the start of the summer.  This counselor worked at Stanford Sierra camp for a few weeks before leaving but was incredibly isolated due to his physical condition.  Michelle had only just met him, but was undoubtedly his best friend on staff, always in tune with his perspective and needs even after he left.  He continues to feel a valued part of the community, no doubt, due to Michelle's patient and kind listening ear.","5","All of our kids absolutely loved Michelle!  She has an absolutely radiant presence around children and has an uncanny knack for accessing their joy.  Without hesitation, she dresses as a superhero, she pretends to be a mermaid, she makes up songs and dances and games and rhymes.","2","This was a difficult question to answer.  Michelle brings an incredible amount of energy to group situations, and this energy is predominantly in the form of care and excitement for her work.  It is impossible to forget the importance of work with children when in the presence of Michelle's energy.  Michelle has directly told me, however, that she feels most recharged by intimate one on one conversations.  ","Absolutely none.","No.","2018-12-05 20:14:33","public","2018-12-05 21:43:00","public","68.40.58.71","3","1"
"136","Ben","Patton","pattonbc@stanford.edu","2602500258","Vincent","Busque","My wife Jill and I are Resident Fellows in Otero.  We met Vincent during the staff hiring process in February of this year, and we hired him to be an RA for Otero.  We've been working with him closely since September this year when fall quarter began.","4","Vincent works well with other committed members of the group, and I think would thrive in an environment where everybody is committed and working together (he has said as much). He pitches in frequently and often thinks about the good of the team and the health of the team when he makes decisions. Overall, he is a very team-oriented person.

He does struggle when others are not as focused on organization & tasks that need to get done, and he gets frustrated when others contribute in other ways (more social ways) but don’t contribute to the nuts & bolts of the tasks at hand.  Those different styles clearly frustrate him, since I think the goal-oriented work comes easier to him than the laid-back & play elements of the job.  He has been trying to bridge the gap between styles, but hasn’t been able to draw the group together, yet. 
","4","Vincent has been good about communicating as critical issues come up and during our weekly staff meetings.  He is responsive, and he does check in with his team about activities being planned.  He is also very responsive and steps up when others request help. He doesn’t go-it-alone; he prefers to get buy-in and support from the team.
","5","Vincent has done really well in stressful situations, including a situation where a student came to him with serious thoughts of self-harm.  Vincent was calm throughout, was able to work through the “QPR” (Question, Persuade, Refer) process to understand more about potential suicidal thoughts, and got the student to agree to go to the hospital with him.  He followed up multiple times afterward with the student, and made sure that things here headed in the right direction. 

He was also the responding staff member during the first week of school when a student’s brother died suddenly. In that situation, Vincent was responsive, calm, caring and supportive.

Overall, he is always thoughtful about what he says and how he communicates. The times I’ve seen him stressed have been about team dynamics if people aren’t pitching in.  But when it comes to helping others, he’s calm and reliable.
 
","5","Vincent has been very committed when things need to get done (beginning of the year dorm setup, reserving a house for snow trip, fielding immediate issues that come up in the dorm). He has been a solid member of the team from the start and has been one of the key organizers of our staff group. When Vincent is in charge, we can trust that the work will get done, and will be done well.
","4","Vincent is a thoughtful listener, and displays care for the people he’s supporting. He was crucial to supporting a student with acute mental health concerns, and was able to get that person to agree to going to the hospital to get immediate medical support.
","4","I wouldn’t call Vincent goofy or silly, though he is probably more conservative about how he acts around me because I am his supervisor. In house meetings, he does get people laughing with self-deprecating off-hand jokes, but I haven’t seen a lot of goofing around. He is thoughtful, kind, and caring, and friendly with our kids (3- and 4-year-olds) when he’s with them. I can imagine him enjoying being around and working with children.
","3","
Vincent is high-energy when it comes to getting stuff done, working intensely, planning, and preparing. 

Socially, I think he is a mix of introverted & extroverted (thus the “3” ranking).  He had a great time co-leading a fountain-hopping trip with the residents and thrived off of the positive energy of the group.  On the other hand, he can be overpowered by larger personalities & more outwardly social people.  During on-call events, Vincent has gotten frustrated when other dominant personalities take over the attention.  He doesn’t demand to be the center of attention, and he doesn’t naturally command the focus of a large group of people, but he can do so when needed (making house meeting announcements, for example).

","No, I'm sure would be responsible and caring.","","2018-12-05 22:41:00","public","2018-12-05 22:47:30","public","128.12.255.4","3","1"
"137","Chris ","King","soccerkingsf@gmail.com","6503026622","Tule","Horton","I have had the pleasure of knowing Tule for the better half of a decade in various roles within our soccer community. Originally I knew Tule as a player on one of the teams in our club, Marin Football Club, where she was a good player, great teammate and an exceptional person. A team first attitude is always something a coach looks for, but Tule always went about this in a different way which was to truly care about each one of her teammates as people and support them on the field and off.

Our club has a trip that most 7th graders take over the summer to spend three weeks playing soccer in Denmark and Sweden. It’s a trip that’s more about the life experience than it is about the actual competitive soccer portion of things. Tule made this trip as a 7th grader and very much so valued the experience. There are a handful of high school graduates that have been on the trip as players that we ask to go on the trip as chaperones/assistant coaches. As chaperones they are responsible for their team of 16 players at all times. They stay in the dorm rooms with them, make sure they get to the dining hall for all their meals, help transport them around the city, mediate plenty of pre-teen dramas, and all in all make sure that they enjoy and value their experience.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2018-12-05 23:01:45","public","2018-12-05 23:04:04","public","128.12.255.4","2","0"

"139","Ana","Cabrera","acabr124@stanford.edu","3053161402","Jack","Golub","I have known Jack for three years now in both a personal and professional setting. I first collaborated with him in Dorm Government during our first year at Stanford where he was Dorm President and I was treasurer of a first year dorm with 85 residents. This year Jack and I staff the same first year dorm at Stanford as part of a team composed of six student staff members where he is a Resident Assistant and I am the Resident Computer Consultant.
","5","As part of a team, Jack is a reliant and passionate member.  Jack is never afraid to push our team to think twice about the way we are approaching problems and decisions. He always wants to make sure we make the best decision, not the easiest one. I tend to be a very strong headed person, but Jack always has the ability to make me question my beliefs. He has that power on teams: that ability to persuade and to question without sounding condescending. ","5","On our staff meetings Jack is usually one of the first people who asks if we are all ok/on the same page before rushing to the next session. He is responsive to all of our group slack messages and has never let us out of the loop on any team decision. Jack is a very easy person to communicate with, and whenever he senses an issue arising that is affecting our team dynamics he reaches out and to address it right away. On the opposite side, he is also a person who is always open to constructive criticism, takes it well, and immediately makes an effort to address it. All in all, he is a team player, and puts trust and communication in his team above everything else. ","5","Being a Resident Assistant can be a very stressful job and in the one quarter we have been staffing together we have already faced tough situations that require immediate, on your feet decisions. Jack was unfortunate, or maybe fortunate enough, to handle our first alcohol related medical transport. It all happened quickly and he had to leave the dorm in the span of seconds and make a quick decision to call the paramedics. As a team we worried about his headspace after all of this happened so quickly, but when he came back he remained calm and was confident on his decision. I am glad he was the first person on our team to handle a transport, because honestly I can't think of any of us who could have done it better.","5","Jack is very open to taking on new responsibilities and always trying to help out on the team. He took on a lot this quarter by leading the team and drafting our first ELF grant proposal and was granted a monetary grant to take our whole dorm to watch the movie Bohemian Rhapsody. He took this on willingly while still taking on handling the transportation for our winter trip to Tahoe. You can always count on Jack to help out and take on responsibilities in the team. 
","5","Jack is one of the best listeners I know. In his role as a Resident Assistant I have seen Jack pushing residents to improve themselves by listening to them and making inquisitive and  insightful comments. He probably has the most meaningful conversations with residents. He tends to be a very spiritual person, with Dalai Lama quotes at hand when necessary and always drawing the deeper conversations out of residents. He is more than willing to listen to the needs of our community and lead not only the important conversations, but also the hardest conversations that our society tends to shift away from. ","5","Jack tends to be a very well liked member of the staff by the residents. One minute he can be setting up pranks with the residents, and the next he will enforce the rules. He does well in managing when to be an enforcer and when to be silly and goofy, and that is why the residents love him. I imagine him playing games with the campers and questioning their thoughts to improve themselves. He is not new to kids, he has worked with kids before and thrives in that environment. I can already imagine him dressed up in goofy clothes and cracking jokes all around, but I can also see him pull his stern face and crack down while still wearing his goofy clothes. Jack does not only lead the community, he builds it.","4","Jack feeds off the energy of the room. He can draw this energy in a wide range of topics, from fun programming announcements to a tutorial on how to flush the toilets in the dorm. Even when he is tired, he does not let that get in the way of his interactions with residents. I would not say he is a super energetic person jumping around all the time, but he can muster that energy whenever it is truly needed.","This applicant has worked with children before in a variety of settings. Most of our conversations tend to drift into the public school versus charter school debate because Jack wants to improve the education of all children and is constantly looking for ways to reform our education system. I could not think of someone more qualified to work with children. ","Jack is one of the most passionate individuals I have met in my short lived life. He is driven, compassionate, and never afraid to speak up for what he believes in. His capacity for empathy is outstanding, and when it comes to problem solving he would not leave a single stone unturned to try to help. Jack has a strong passion for children and education, and this passion is visible in everything he does. He is amazing with kids, and I have no doubt that he can do this job better than most people our age.","2018-12-06 00:50:01","public","2018-12-06 01:55:16","public","128.12.255.4","3","1"

My wife and I are Resident Fellows (RF’s) at Stanford. We've stayed in contact with Jess over the years through visits at our cottage, and she also took a class we taught this past Spring 2018 called Stanford Loves: The Theory and Practice of Conscious Relationship. (I’d also like to share, if it helps you weigh my evaluation of Jess, that in my professional life, I am a psychologist and therapist, as well as being a former director of spiritual care at a hospice in San Diego and former director of a marriage and family therapy graduate program. I care very deeply about others relating compassionately, genuinely, and skillfully to those who are hurting and who have lost loved ones.)","5","Jess is kind, warm, open, growth-oriented, and willing to be vulnerable. She desires genuine connections with people and seeks that out. She is reflective and a true practitioner of self growth, meaning, she will take in feedback and apply it wholeheartedly. She was always willing to share first in class, she set a beautiful tone that allowed others to feel comfortable being more real. ","5","Jess is able to speak reflectively about her inner life, put words to her feelings, and be brave enough to sit in, and through, interpersonal discomfort-- meaning-- she is totally capable of honest communication with others. She really wants it as a daily way of living her life. Practically, she was always an attentive and thoughtful listener of others in class. I can easily imagine her communicating her needs and also valuing the needs of others with sincerity and equity. ","5","Jess has come to my wife and I several times and disclosed difficult experiences in her own life and in the lives of friends around her that she cares about. These were intense situations that absolutely were stress inducing. Jess maintained balance and perspective while wholeheartedly conveying love and concern. Her reaching out was an example of her self-awareness and healthy behavior in managing stress. I could easily imagine her managing it mindfully in your community.","5","Jess always took initiative in our class and in our frosh community. I believe the same would be true at Camp Kesem. She would do so with an awareness of herself as well as her impact on others.","5","Jess knows her own pain, and can talk about it and from it, but isn't stuck in it. She is humble and courageous and interested in processing difficult feelings. Others feel comfortable sharing their honest moments with her because you can feel she has been there herself, and wants to listen. Like a kind of wordless empathy--again, in class, her going ""first"" allowed others to feel like they could too. And when they shared, she was engaged, present, and warm. She made space for people to just be themselves.","5","Jess could absolutely be silly, playful, and fun with campers. I think she'd totally enjoy that as a way of entering their world and just hanging out. I also believe she could draw boundaries and bring a more stern voice when needed. She's not interested in the power of the position, she wanting to connect with them.","3","In the contexts we've seen her, Jess is a great blend of introverted and extroverted. She can be comfortable in both.","None at all!","My wife and I think Jess is a fearless, heartfelt, loving, wonderful person, and we are so excited that she has decided to apply at Camp Kesem. The young people would love her, and it would mean the world to her too, being in their lives. She would be a good peer, is utterly responsible, knows to ask for help, and would want to do the best job possible all around.

She joined a small group of American and Vietnamese college students, leading a three week day camp for rural youth.  She taught volleyball, English, and life skills, and mentored one group of kids closely.  I was on the ground with the team throughout, so was closely involved seeing Anna in action.","5","Good teamwork likewise is essential to our camps, with the added challenges of it being 3 and a half weeks long, and being a mix of counselors from two very different countries.  

Anna was really easy to live and work with.  She was active and had many of her own ideas she contributed, but flowed easily and didn't impose her vision.","5","No issues whatsoever.  Anna has good people and communication skills, and is mature.","5","Certainly many challenging circumstances come up in our camps too (though maybe not as frequently).  Anna seems to be someone who keeps and even keel and is pretty unflappable in most any situation.","5","Even though I keep putting 5 in every category so far, it is really because Anna has shown herself to be a mature, quality person who can be relied on in situations very similar to those at Camp Kesem.  As mentioned above, Anna is mature and responsible, and takes initiative.","4","A common challenge in our groups is for the Americans to learn to listen and not dominate the lesson planning and conversations.  The American counselors are used to jumping in with their ideas and hardly leaving a gap in conversation for the less assertive Vietnamese to gather their thoughts and contribute.  

Anna worked very well with her Vietnamese counterparts, actively seeking their views and encouraging their input.","4","We are not with campers in lodging situations, but are with them 8 hours a day for 3 weeks.  Certainly a big part of the program is finding that balance between being a leader with clear expectations and being silly and playful to connect with the kids.  Anna did well.","4","While not one of those rare counselors who just seem to have energy coming out their ears at all times, Anna certainly has plenty, even though she isn't quite as bubbly, and she is very dedicated and focused on the kids and what needs to be done.  Lack of energy or motivation was never remotely an issue.","Not remotely.","Anna was really great in a counselor role last summer.  I am glad she is seeking to continue to contribute positively to kids.  I recommend her wholeheartedly.","2018-12-06 10:34:07","public","2018-12-06 10:57:19","public","198.86.29.21","3","1"

In this role I hired, trained, and supervised him throughout the summer. Coleman and I first met a few summers earlier when he was a counselor in training. This past summer I challenged Coleman by making him a Head Counselor when he had 4 weeks less experience than the other head counselors in the unit. He came into the summer slightly surprised to learn the immense responsibility I had entrusted him with, but quickly stepped up to the fill the role I needed him to. He is an adaptable counselor who obviously cares about those around him. At Camp Becket we try to give often constructive feedback to the counselors to ensure they are preforming to the best of their ability and in all facets of the job. Coleman was one of the few guys that I could count on to complete all the little things without reminders. He has a broad range of interests from quantum physics to competitive running and many things in between that allowed him to excel at one on one interactions with a huge spectrum of campers.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2018-12-06 13:13:30","public","2018-12-06 13:14:31","public","150.209.35.82","2","0"

During his time in our LIT program he spent three weeks on the Cheyenne River Reservation working with Lakota youth and three weeks in MA working with youth from the northeast primarily.  Coleman earned and has successfully completed two years on staff including the summer of 2018 where he was a head counselor.","5","Coleman is a fabulous contributor to a team environment.  He is incredibly hard-working and can be relied up to complete any task given to him.  I have seen Coleman positively problem solve with other staff to improve the camper experience.  He is incredibly positive and will often set that tone in meetings.  ","5","Coleman is a wonderful communicator.  His peers and co-counselors are always aware of how things are going and areas where support may be needed.  He is incredibly honest and will also feel comfortable going to ""administration"" to become a part of solutions to problems effecting the community.","5","Coleman is amazingly even-keeled.  He cares deeply but his emotions will be kept in check.  He is often the anchor in a group when it comes to emotional stability.","5","Again with Coleman having a summer already as a head counselor, this was something witnessed daily.  We rely on our staff in a similar way and he has displayed these actions in our setting.","5","His campers always felt comfortable sharing with him.  He approached each one of them with empathy and compassion.  Coleman will also have peers seek him out for a listening ear.","4","Coleman is engaging with his campers.  I didn't give him a 5 because he is not often ""goofy and silly"" but he is often creative and able to carry a theme through an activity.","5","We are also working on Diversity and Inclusion in our setting so Coleman is very used to having these conversations and being aware of actions to the contrary.

"150","Megan","Calfas","mcalfas@stanford.edu","3105603910","Meg","Enthoven","I was Meg's freshman RA in Donner two years ago and worked with her this past summer at Stanford Sierra Camp. ","5","Since the very start of her freshman year, Meg has stepped up in every community I've seen her in to do extra work for the good of the group. She never shies away from working hard and has a keen sense of social awareness for those around her. At Sierra Camp this summer, she was a vocal advocate for inclusivity and would respectfully work to make everyone feel comfortable and supported in all social and work spaces. She was a favorite among her 5-6 year old campers--manager and peer feedback showed that she was constantly engaged, not only attentive enough to ensure safety, but also able to rise up and provide extra elements of imagination and magic for the kids whenever possible. All this was done in teams--her co-counselor group at Camp was one of the closest of the summer and seemingly most hard-working. She is able to strike a balance of providing social support while still getting the job done. ","4","Very well--Meg will speak her mind. But, she is open to hearing other perspectives and makes sure to check in with the rest of her community before any decisions are made. I think she can sometimes struggle if she feels her peers are not providing the same respect back to her--she can lose trust in people if they seem rude, selfish, or not-so-hardworking from her view. I haven't seen this impede her work though, just her social opinions. (And I have faith in Kesem counselors that this would not come up very often! :) ) ","5","As far as I have seen, Meg can push through stress well. As I mentioned before, she's a very hard worker, and it seems like stress only propels her to ""put her nose to the grindstone"" (is that a real expression? what is a grindstone?) and work harder to make it through the situation. She has a very logistics-oriented mind and would be very pragmatic in times of stress, I think. ","5","Yes! I have seen Meg step up countless times in her communities--whether by planning and executing a very elaborate end-of-year gift for all her fellow Donner residents freshman year (little jars full of personal notes of affirmation for everyone!), writing a song about Sierra Camp to sing and play on her ukelele every week at camp, or being the first to volunteer to go move a heavy object when someone asks for help. At Kesem, I can imagine her as an enthusiastic talent show organizer, very efficient meal-time server + cleaner, and a delighted participant in staying up all night making friendship bracelets for a camper who needs it, should that situation ever arise again. ","5","Definitely. As I mentioned, Meg was a very big advocate of inclusivity at Sierra Camp this summer, which often lead her to be a source of support for quieter staffers. She thrived in one-on-one conversations and seemed always able to make people feel heard and provide the support they needed.","5","Definitely---Meg is a goofy, goofy gal! Could always be seen in her time with the 5-6 year olds at Sierra Camp.","3","Meg really does fall right in the middle I think. She isn't often the one to jump in to tell a long, crazy story to the whole group. But she can bring big energy in things like group cheers and rallying everybody to the next activity. But I think socially and one-to-one, she often is on the quieter spectrum of energy, and could lend solace to those campers who want a grounding force to lean on. ","No!","I don't think so! Happy to answer any other questions if they come up. And good luck with the whole selection process!!!!! Can't wait to see the new smiling Kesem counselor faces :) :) :) 
So wish I could be there this summer!

I have know him for 4 months during which time have had extensive opportunities to get to know him.","5","The dorm RAs must work together to share the work and responsibilities. Jackson always pitches in and up when needed. He works very well with the other members of the team. It should be noted, that none of the RAs knew each other very well when they started, so this has been a learning process for all of us. Jackson has been great at it.","5","Jackson communicates with others on the RA team and with us frequently but appropriately about any issues that arise. His communications are direct and clear.","5","Freshman dorms are not unlike ""camps"" in the sense that they are groups of young people who do not know each other and are facing common problems. Jackson is a very supportive, caring, and dedicated person. He is committed to helping the dorm residents. I am sure this will carry over to a camp situation. He manages stress well.","5","As I have suggested before, Jackson does step up and is often a leader in the group. He does not avoid challenges, in fact, he appears to actively seek them out at times. This means more work for him, but he also sees and experiences the benefits.","5","Jackson is a great listener and the residents in the dorm often turn to him when they need someone to talk to about their classes, friends, Stanford, or more personal matters. He is not judgmental and open.","5","Again, this is not unlike a Frosh dorm...Jackson is fun and can be silly. He is confident enough in himself to allow himself to be playful.","5","Jackson has a high energy level as far as I can tell! He is active in the dorm, is a great student, is an athlete and manages to have friends too!","None at all. I think they will really like him.","Jackson would be great at this. He is already getting on the job training as our Dorm RA!","2018-12-06 14:39:08","public","2018-12-06 14:51:48","public","199.68.152.135","3","1"

"156","Adrian","Amaral","adrian@epatt.org","6507254450","Arielle","Wenokur","Arielle joined East Palo Alto Tennis and Tutoring (EPATT) in the Spring Quarter of 2017-2018 Stanford school year.  Arielle started as a volunteer academic tutor for a student one-on-one twice a week for two hours each session.  For this academic year, Arielle increased her role at EPATT by becoming a Tutor Coordinator.  As 1 of 8 TCs, Arielle’s roles include that of tutor recruitment, tutor on-boarding, and tutoring administration, and tutoring students.  She is responsible for being the admin for 10 EPATT students and their one-on-one tutors.","5","Arielle has great work ethic and works well in a team setting.  She is responsible and works in diligent manner to complete her daily/weekly tutoring administration tasks. She also is great at checking in with Staff and acting upon instruction.","4","Arielle is a great communicator.  Part of being a great communicator is being a great listener and Arielle pay close attention to students needs and offering a hand without doing too much.  Arielle's approach to approach to working with her students was that of being resourceful, finding different ways to explain concepts so they could learn a new perspectives and how to learn and approach problems.","4","Working with students, that of the age of middle schoolers, takes a lot of patience.  Arielle is very patient with her students.  When tough situations arise around school or social life, Arielle takes step back to assess before acting or responding.  If she doesn't know how to handle a situation, she will seek the help and guidance of Staff to see how they would handle that situation with her team of tutors and students.  A situation that comes to mind was that of initial awkwardness between a tutor and tutee.  Arielle approached the tutee and asked him to explain how he felt around his tutor.   The student said,  'he is shy and doesn't say much so I just focus and do my own work.'  Arielle then approached the tutor to get his perspective on how tutoring was going.  Without mention the tutee's comments to the tutor, Arielle gave some advice to the tutor on what he could do to make tutoring more engaging and less awkward.  ","5","Arielle role as Tutor Coordinator is multifaceted from that of tutor on-boarding (interview and training), tutor recruitment, tutor administration (reviewing tutor logs), and tutoring students. Arielle was 110% sure she would be able to commit to the TC position because of her commitments like school, and her lab job, but Arielle stepped up to opportunity has a excelled.  She has great organization, and time management skills. Regarding initiative, Arielle created a tutor log video to send to her tutors so they could see what a ""perfect tutor log"", something that is detailed and honest, looked like so her tutors could report accurately about tutoring sessions.  Other TCs followed on what Arielle create to share to their tutors as well.  ","5","What makes Arielle such great leader is that she always makes himself approachable and available for giving and receiving advice and welcoming constructive criticism all in the efforts to coach up her tutors so that they are making adjustments to ensure that tutors are making academic progress with their tutees.   Students like to approach Arielle and talk about their social life and how they are doing.   Just as she make herself approachable, she gives her students advise and suggestions based from her personal experiences and how they could then respond to what they are going trough.","5","Arielle is great at being able to relate to students and building trust.   A strength of Arielle is her ability to connect with people emotionally.  EPATT assigned Xitlali, her tutee, to Arielle because of Xitlali’s 's lack of academic self confidence.  Arielle approach to working with Xitlali was that of being resourceful, finding different ways to explain concepts so Xitlali could learn a new perspective on how to learn and approach problems.  Arielle’s success as a tutor was the rapport and relationship she was able establish with Xitlali and her team of 10 students by checking in with them about their social-emotional life in and out school. Arielle sets firm boundaries with her students, but Arielle does not take her self to seriously and will laugh and be silly around her students.","4","Arielle comes to EPATT and tutoring with a lot of enthusiasm every day.  Her students take note of that since she greets and checks in with all of her students before their tutor arrive.  Rarely does Arielle have to be stern or be strict because of the rapport and trust she has built with her students.  Her students like talking with Arielle about academics and about their daily lives.","No.  Arielle is great working with children and builds great rapport with them.  She works closely with middle school students who need a lot encouragement, reinforcement.  She is positive, friendly, and stern when needed. ","The act of service and being community minded is a personality trait that is ingrained in Arielle.  To quote Arielle, “For me, EPATT is a community whose goal is to teach life skills to children who unfairly have access to fewer opportunities.  It’s not just a tutoring and tennis program but also an organization that allows me to contribute to and encourage young students to trust in their abilities and look towards a future of success.  I never had a shortage of opportunities growing up and I want to be able to try to provide better circumstances (attempt to even the playing field so to speak) for these young students who will eventually be our future.”  Arielle has remained grounded to what is important to her which is being an active community member and making a meaningful contribution with issues of social justice and education inequality.","2018-12-06 15:14:16","public","2018-12-06 19:26:37","public","171.66.209.5","3","1"

"158","Callie","Heiderscheit","callie@ripplematch.com","5634492201","Daniel","Laporte","I know Danny from two overlapping summers at Sierra Camp -- during one of those summers we shared a counselor group and 100+ spectacular 7-8 year olds. ","5","For the summer Danny and I worked together, his nickname, used by his kids and co-counselors, was ""Hero Danny."" The nickname began the first week, when a little girl's hat fell in the water (she started crying literally instantaneously) and Danny jumped in to get it, swan-diving and fully-clothed, into the still-chilly Tahoe lake after the other four of looked at each other with eyes that said 'Not Me.' Hero Danny is the teammate who never minds working the behind the scenes magic to support his co-counselors and campers. ","5","Danny's clear and honest with his feedback, but keeps a positive framework for the few of us (me) that are more sensitive to feedback. My favorite thing about Danny's communication style, though, is that he happy to take initiative with conversations he thinks a team would just generally benefit from having. He'd admitted in pre-summer preparations that he was nervous about improvising during down time (which he ended up being great at anyway) so he asked us upfront about ways to prepare and how he'd want to receive feedback in the moment. After programming sessions of our first week he'd ask how we thought it went/ideas he had about next time. ","5","Part of Danny's 'Hero Danny' status meant that he was the **most composed out of the five of us in basically every situation all summer. There was this six year old we had in the group who probably shouldn't have been with the Hunes, and had some trouble during the week getting frustrated with programming/other kids and would cry. He attached to Danny pretty immediately because Danny was the only one he felt comfortable with -- which I think was because of Danny's composure and patience. He would sit with him forever at the beginning of the week, and then by the end, Danny could feel better and calm before the crying started. (side note, on Danny's day off, this boy just fell to pieces without him and we had no idea what to do, it was a whole thing). ","5","Danny's first summer he was in the kitchen, working hours at a time on a job that was basically random difficult tasks with no preparation (I only have occasionally done parts of these shifts and they are beyond tough). Then when he'd finish, he'd jump from that to something like Kid's Carnival, where we'd be silly and console more crying kids and by hype for the big games we were tasked with making up ourselves. My time with Danny was defined by his flexibility, his energy, and his ability to bring his best to a ton of different roles -- whether that was coming up with a marshmallow statue game that made a bunch of kiddos literally cry with laughter or it was cleaning up a gooey marshmallow mess after. That boy is always game. ","5","Top notch. I've witnessed Danny listen to a 7 year old talk about a single game of Minecraft for the entire duration of a 1.5 hour mountainside hike. And that's nothing compared to the hours he's listened to me talk about my opinion of four dollar wine versus nine dollar wine in the Narnia kitchen post Special D. In full seriousness: Danny gives others as much space as they need and when you talk you know he's listening. He's also somehow miles better about it with kids -- it's something I'm grateful to have seen in person!! ","5","I've seen Danny attempt (key word: attempt) to climb a rock wall backwards because some kids asked him too. I've also seen kids paint on him, pie him, sing songs with him while, again, climbing a mountain. I've seen him jump under a pontoon, sit under the boat for a couple minutes, and then come up and pretend he found a clue to a secret treasure at the bottom (again, when his co-counselors didn't want to). Danny has a really special way with kids because he honestly just wants to make sure they have the best time and is energized by the possibility of that. ","5","This question feels complicated to me because I would definitely rank Danny a '5' for energy, but I also think part of what makes his interactions with kids so cool is that he's always happy and able to switch gears when it's necessary. He shouts the group chant and plays Natural Disaster with expert energy levels when the situation calls for it, but I think it's really important to him that he makes kids who don't take up as much space feel cared for -- a lot of times that means bringing down the energy and having a calmer chat. I would consider that balance one of his strongest kids/community skills, but I don't know for sure if that's what you mean by '5!' ","No","Danny's the best. He cares about kids a ton and is really good with them, too. He'd be a really excellent pick -- trust me!!","2018-12-06 16:29:33","public","2018-12-06 17:27:43","public","204.148.13.194","3","1"

"160","Michelle","Huang","mhuang19@stanford.edu","6504476392","Lily","Randhawa","I worked with Lily at a summer camp for one month during the summer of 2018. The summer camp was a design thinking & computer science bootcamp for high schoolers in Gaza City, Palestine. We both taught as design thinking instructors.","5","The summer camp we taught at last summer required us to create a very rigorous curriculum for the students. Lily went above and beyond with her co-instructor; not only did they often stay up late multiple nights in a row to perfect the material, but she even learned computer science skills in order to better support her co-instructor. As the design thinking instructor this was not necessary at all, but as a result, their classroom ran very smoothly.","5","Lily is honest and trusting. More importantly, she really listens to what others have to say. She makes space for others and clearly articulates her thoughts when helpful. She also didn't avoid the negative emotions--when she felt tired or uneasy, she voiced her opinions. When there were group decisions that had to be made, such as whether to teach a certain day or give the kids a break, she gave insightful and honest opinions.","5","I've been with Lily in some of the most high stress situations I've ever experienced. While we were in Gaza, there was an airstrike on the second day that nearly resulted in our evacuation. During this time Lily maintained her composure beautifully. She was a source of comfort to me as well as others. She was also the first instructor to message her students, who weren't with us at the time, to open a line of communication between instructors and students. Lily's deep capacity for caring really shone during that trying time and it was obvious what a thoughtful and loving individual she is.","5","As mentioned earlier, Lily went above and beyond her duties as a design thinking instructor to learn computer science basics in order to help her co-instructor. No one, not even her co-instructor, asked her to do this--she made this decision on her own accord to be as supportive as possible.","5","Even though Lily taught 19 students, she had a knack for remembering all of their names very early on along with details about their lives. She was always sitting with students during meals and asking them about events of the previous day and other interests, making the kids light up since they got to talk about something they cared about with someone who remembered.","5","I think I would have to submit videos of Lily line dancing with the students to fully show how uninhibited she was around the students! She had an amazing skill of being able to control a classroom but also turn around and hang with the best of them. She was always looped in on the hot gossip, and when a couple of her students pulled her aside to ""teach her extra moves to outdance the other instructors,"" she let them teach her with a laugh and a fantastic attitude. ","3","Lily is always down. She won't be the loudest person in the room, nor will she be the one who's always commanding the spotlight, but she will always be there during social situations. Lily never stayed in the hotel room during outings--she took ever opportunity she got to explore and hang out, whether that be roaming around the city with the students or late night deep conversations with one or two instructors.","None","The summer camp we worked at last year was a truly extraordinary setting. It was, no doubt, high stress--we were teaching a group of extremely high-achieving high schoolers in a place that has been described as the world's largest open-air prison. There were intense emotional intricacies of balancing students' deep ambitions with the tragic reality of the situation. Through it all, Lily acted with grace and spontaneity and joy. She met her students in their highest highs and during their lowest lows. She took it upon herself to make sure they knew they were cared for, supported, and believed in, not because of her role as an instructor but because of her deep investment in their lives. The camp itself was brief but Lily gave it her all. She went above and beyond in everything that was asked of her and things that weren't. All the while, she maintained genuine relationships and invested individually in her students. Camp Kesem is very different from Code for Palestine in many regards, but at its core, I suspect it requires the same tenderness, patience, and genuine care from its instructors. If this is the case then I can't think of a better instructor than Lily. ","2018-12-06 19:10:12","public","2018-12-06 21:30:46","public","68.65.169.4","3","1"

I was the Camp Director and Maya was the staff member for our Day Camp.","5","Maya treats everyone with respect and dignity and understands when to work for something greater. After one season of Day Camp, she accepted to be the Youth Staff Leader for the following year. She does not have an ego in what she does.","5","Maya has shown through our camp an extraordinary ability to communicate. Both as a counselor and as our Youth Staff Leader, she has the ability to communicate to management, her peers, and her campers.","5","Maya has the ability to handle stress. She enjoys working with youth and the camp setting. She also has a positive attitude. One example of a time that she had a couple of staff members under her that were not doing their jobs at the station they were running. Maya kept her composure and came to the Program Director to ask for help and suggestions on how to handle the situation. Then, she applied those methods and coached her staff members into doing their jobs.","5","Maya will always step up and take the initiative. Maya is a leader for her peers. As a station instructor, she made sure that her staff was in shape and that her campers were engaged, even if they were playing a game because the lesson did not take long enough. As a Youth Staff Leader the year after that, her job for the twelve months was to help us recruit, train our youth staff, market camp for campers, and make sure smooth operations during the week. In doing this, she took the initiative and really made sure that camp was something special. Maya was also the President for Piedmont High Adventure Crew and Executive Member of Piedmont Community Service Crew. I also got to work with Maya as the President of Piedmont Council's Venturing Officers Association. This was a meeting of the youth leaders of all of our Venturing Crews and Exploring Posts in the Council to talk about different topics to strengthen their programs.","5","On her first year of Day Camp Staff, Maya ran our Scout Skills station. Since she had not grown up in the traditional Boy Scout program, she did not have the same engrained knowledge of these skills such as knot tying or orienteering. Maya did an excellent job of working and engaging with her station aids who had been Boy Scouts about the best ways to operate the station. ","5","Maya and some other staffers instituted a campfire as a new program to end the week with. We put a fake campfire out in the park. Each of our groups put together some skits and songs. Maya was the MC for this that year.","5","During high Maya did about 10-15 extra curricular activities at the same time. When Maya would rattle off the different things that she was doing, our Program Director would look at me and just ask how. Maya not only has the energy, but knows how to use it efficiently to make things enjoyable.","None what so ever. Maya has a passion for working with youth. She really enjoys it and in working with her, I could see that it is fulfilling for her.","I cannot stress enough, Maya has already done the job you are asking her to do and was wonderful at it. She will not only make sure the campers have a good time, but will be sensitive and nurturing with this environment that you have. Maya is an example of a servant leader. She naturally earns the respect of her peers and takes the initiative to do something with it. Maya made our camp so much better just by being on staff.","2018-12-06 21:31:31","public","2018-12-06 22:15:07","public","67.188.49.145","3","1"

I also know her from tour guiding and because she is currently the PHE in Serra, the first-year dorm where I staffed last year.

Sofia and I were also in a relationship for one year during Sophomore year.","5","Sofia is a lively and avid member of many of the student and academic organizations that she is part of.

She is one of the friendliest and easy-going people that I know, and she is very capable of using that skill to make teams work more effectively. ","5","","4","After being friends with Sofia for over three years, I know her to handle stressful situations very well. However, one point I would make is that she works much better in dealing with those situations when she is not in isolation (e.g. if she can talk through the situation at hand with someone else who is there).","5","","5","Being empathetic and listening to issues that folks deal with, I believe, is one of Sofia's strongest qualities. It's one of the primary reasons our staff last year in Serra, along with the RFs, unanimously ranked her as our #1 choice for PHE.","5","","5","She is very very energetic and extroverted.
