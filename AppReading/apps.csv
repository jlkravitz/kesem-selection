Dates: July-September 2018
Description: Took care of nine-month-old baby while his mom went to work on weekdays. 

Role: Sunday School Helper
Dates: August 2013-March 2014
Description: Helped Sunday School teachers with arts and crafts, teaching the kids.",,"1. For all my life, but mostly in the last three years, I have dedicated a lot of my free time to my younger siblings, as my brother entered high school three years ago and my sister did just this past August. My brother especially was reliant on my guidance and encouragement through his transition from middle school to high school as I helped him navigate the balance between his social life and academic responsibilities.
2. I have been an active participant in my church since my freshman year of high school as I helped to organize the first of a now-annual conference on theological education, cleaned monthly, and watched other members' kids in the nursery during some services. 
3. During the last two years (my junior and senior years of high school) I spent time volunteering as a math tutor at my school, staying after school once a week to help kids with their work for free.","For the first ten years of my life I spent every summer at my grandparents’ house in Grosse Pointe, Michigan, with my aunts, uncles, and ten cousins. We fished off the dock in the backyard, swam in the pool, went to the swim club for the Fourth of July (my mom’s birthday), and spent most afternoons all together eating my grandma’s cooking in her kitchen and spent most nights with my cousins playing downstairs or watching Jaws on repeat. 
	My grandparents would throw their annual Big Slide Party - a name coined by us fourteen grandchildren - when my family was in town. They hired a big inflatable slide (as the name suggests) for the backyard, a cotton candy machine, the Wally’s ice cream truck, and Coney Island hot dogs, for all of us to use as we pleased while we raced around the backyard and dove into the pool. This one day a year, surrounded by my family, makes me realize how lucky I am to have such a close, supportive family, and how important that support is in a child’s life, as well as how much I want to give that to someone else who needs it. ","1) Being raise in a Christian household, I was taught empathy and kindness to everyone is necessary, be it towards a friend, stranger, or rival. This is something I have carried with me and do my best to implement in every aspect of life. 
2) I have a broad (and sometimes odd) sense of humor, having grown up the eldest of four kids, and so will probably find any joke anyone tells funny enough to laugh at. 
3) I’m not a good singer or dancer, but if there’s music playing I’ll act as though I am.
","I would love to teach art at camp. In some form or another, art has always been a foundational aspect of my life, from classes in school as a kid making pottery or marker-drawings, to sketching and painting in acrylics now. Creativity is necessary to a person’s psyche and a way to self-express thoughts, feelings, and ideas into a visual form. When you create art you don’t have to think about anything but the art itself, making it a perfect outlet for kids going through such experiences. ","I grew up in a family and with parents who always made me feel heard, no matter how young I was. When at six I decided I was going to be a marine biologist, my parents bought me a DVD set of Jacques Cousteau. When at nine I declared I was going to open a pet store, my dad helped me research dogs to purchase for it. When at fourteen I tried my hand at writing a full novel, my mom read every iteration of that novel for four years. When at seventeen I applied to colleges, my parents said no matter what happens, they’re proud. 
	Children are young, inexperienced, and naive, but that is all the more reason to give them this support and encouragement - to give them a foundation to return to in times of doubt and difficulty. No one deserves to experience the loss of a parent, or even the threat of it, especially not a child. I want to volunteer at Camp Kesem to give these kids that foundation, to give them something steady and constant to lean upon while they persevere.

I think that the opportunity to work with the OLP kids would allow me to share one of my passions with these students - the outdoors. I think that as a 15- and 16-year-old, there is a beauty and freedom that the outdoors can give you to. The ability to take ownership of your presence in the outdoors is a responsibility that is empowering in and of itself. When you add in LNT (leave no trace) principles, along with the basic skills to enjoy your trip outdoors, there are a multitude of layers to growth that can occur. I also believe that, as someone who grew up in a family where camping outdoors was not common, that exposure to camping/hiking are great ways to rekindle self-love and affirmation, alongside time to reflect and think. I am in the Wilderness First Aid course to be certified as a Wilderness First Aid Responder and I am currently (through May 2019) am CPR and Lifeguard certified. I am a frosh RA, and as such feel equipped to work with 15- and 16-year-olds.","Role: Tutor (K–12 Grade) @ Temecula Public Library

Dates: Summers 2012-2017
Description: As a swim coach, I gave private swim lessons and coached groups of kids aged 2-15. In private lessons, I taught how to swim or improve their technique. I also organized and led practices, which included swim games and competitions.
","I have not worked at a camp in the past, however I am excited to get the opportunity to!
","Role: Residential Assistant (RA) in Otero: 
Dates: September 2018 – present. 
Description: As an RA, I have made close connections with residents, starting immediately from NSO. I really enjoy hanging out with residents especially through outdoor activities (frisbee, spikeball, and basketball) as well grabbing meals with them in the dining hall. At the same time, I have helped many residents work through very serious situations while also enjoying just hanging out with my residents. Through being an RA, I have learned to read the situation on when I should be a goofball and when my residents need me to be serious.

Role: President of Stanford Club Swimming
Dates: Fall 2017-present.
Description: Swimming was such a huge part of my life before college and I am lucky to still have swimming in college. I have worked with other members of club swimming to organize recruitment of new members, give constant encouragement during practices, write workouts, organize travel, and help organize social events. I believe the area that I have impacted the group most has been the HYPE I try and bring to every workout. Every day, I try to be my most enthusiastic and encouraging self I can be to provide that little extra boost to others and myself during practice. 
","When I see a box of Jell-O powder, my stomach tingles from excitement. To me, that is no ordinary powder. To me, Jell-O powder represents something greater. To me, Jell-O powder is “Power Powder.” 
Each summer growing up I was part of a swim team that had meets every week. While we were not the best team, we did have something that the other teams did not. We had Power Powder. The stuff made us invincible, or so we believed. My favorite memories from childhood are lining up behind the blocks with by hand outstretched, just waiting to get a handful of Power Powder. 
	When the Power Powder entered my system and my sugar rush began, I believed I could do anything. We had our secret powder, which only members of my team knew about. I forget who won our races or what place I got in the race, but I never forgot the feeling I got before my race. I felt like I had the power of the whole team as I digested the Jell-O powder. I cannot help but get nostalgic when I see that powder and I am thankful for the tradition of our team. By repainting the box and naming it “Power Powder,” my coaches took an ordinary food item and let our imagination do the rest.
","I am extremely open about my life. Ask me anything and I would love to talk about it. I believe this is one of the reasons I can make close connections with people quickly. Opening up about myself provides a more comfortable space for other people to share more about themselves. 

Meals are my favorite time to really get to know someone. I love food. I love people. Combine the two and I cannot get much happier. Sharing that happiness with someone creates a special bond between the two (or more) of us. I truly believe I can get to know someone having one meal with them. I do not know exactly what it is about the setting about a meal is, but the small talk that is often associated with conversations seems to disappear and be replaced by strong connections through real conversation.

I am a dad. I might not have any offspring of my own, but I really am a dad. It might be the Dad jokes, or how I often talk about wanting kids very shortly after college, or the fact that I NEED to wave to babies. I believe it stems from really loving to be there for people. When I hear it, I think it is the best compliment someone can give me. It shows that I shamelessly care about others and will anything for those I am close to.","I have only been to one summer camp in my life, but I have a very distinct memory of the most epic game of capture the flag. I am not sure if capture the flag happens at Camp Kesem, but I would love to part of organizing a game of capture the flag. This game requires teamwork, tenacity, perseverance, and creativity. It is one of my favorite games and I would love to bring it to Camp Kesem. 
","I can make a difference in the lives of those whom I grew up not knowing how to help, but always wanting to. My mom is a hematologist at Stanford hospital and works with a lot of patients who have or have had cancer. Her job takes a huge emotional toll on my mom, and I could not imagine the toll it takes on the families of those who she treats. While she does her best to support the families of her patients in the hospital, my mom always talks about how supporting the families, especially after they lose a family to cancer, is the hardest part. Camp Kesem is my chance to help those families who are touched so closely with cancer. The setting of Camp Kesem provides campers a space to reflect on how cancer has affected their lives in both a serious and joyful way. As an RA, I balance providing a space for my residents to engage in formal personal reflection while providing room for them to have fun and enjoy spending time with the people around them. I love my job and I hope to bring this balance to Camp Kesem.
In addition, I am excited at the prospect to get to really know the campers, frolic in the outdoors, choose my camp name, and grow as a team. Lastly, I am thrilled for the chance to work with fellow councilors in my unit to provide the campers a magical week they will never forget.","I was born in Montreal, Canada. I moved to California when I was 3 years old. I had just started to speak French at home when I moved here and my world was turned upside down. I spent the next two years unlearning French so I could learn English. During that time in preschool, I did not talk. I had maybe one friend because I was the “silent kid.” Sadly, my earliest memories are filled with loneliness because I was unable to communicate with the people in my preschool. It took a few years, but since I became comfortable with English I have been trying to make up for my lack of speaking in preschool. This experience has also made me look out for those who are on the quieter side. Some people prefer not to talk, and while it is sometimes more difficult to engage with them, it does not mean they are not worth engaging with. I want to prevent the quiet ones from feeling isolated like I was early on in my childhood. 
","I love puns. Here are some (hopefully mediocre) puns that tell you a little bit more about my life.

I grew up in the Bay Area. I love it here. It’s Sunnyvale at least 10 months out of the year. I grew up swimming on the Daly, catching those rays, doing my best to get sTANford. I didn’t end up getting tan; my skin was constantly Redwood. In the winters, my skin recovered. We had practices on Christmas, but SANTA Clara always visited us. I trained so much I had to eat an abNORmal number of CALories to keep my weight up. Swimming took up an AtherTON of my life, but at Stanford I turned to a new chapter of my life: being premed. 

When I came to Stanford. I tried CS, I tried economics, but in the end, we just did not have chemistry. I became certain I wanted to healium people for a living. Two years of learning about covalent bonds and cations later, I learned the essential life skills of sharing what I have and staying positive. My sophomore year, I took the human biology but I sadly thought it rather BOHRing. Through this, I still managed some save some time to be active. I swam in electron pools and Plancked a lot. To me, the most important thing was not to DarWIN, but to try my best. 

There are many more puns where this came from and I would love to bring them to Camp Kesem.

","In 6th grade, I definitely wasn’t the most athletic kid, but mustered the courage to try out for my school’s soccer team. Unsurprisingly, I was either on bench or at defense because of my lack of coordination. Almost always, I’d be seen kicking the ball out-of-bounds almost every time I had the ball, tripping over myself as I chased other players, or running past a ball flying by me. Apparently I’d even just stop to watch my teammates in fascination of how well they played even though I was in the game. 

But in our last game, my coach called me over and asked me to do the unthinkable. He put me in as striker. I was terrified! I could barely pass the ball, let alone shoot it at a goal with someone blocking shots and using their hands. I mainly scrambled around the field, but soon after my teammate got fouled. Our strongest player Charlie lined up to take the kick, signaling me to run up the field. As I saw him kick the ball, all I remember is chasing the ball as it flew through the sky, closing my eyes, and hoping for the best. The ball hit off my head, passing the goalie, and hitting the back of the net. I was in complete shock, wondering how this had just happened. But as I turned around, my teammates came running at me, jumping in excitement, giving huge bear hugs, and celebrating a moment I’ll never forget. ","My biggest passion is in destigmatizing mental health, encouraging people to practice self-care, and helping others grow emotionally by empowering them to be open and vulnerable. 

I like to think of myself as a board game enthusiast and have an ever-growing collection of some of the best board games you will ever play.

I’m not the best dancer, but I’ll start grooving and dancing whenever music starts playing.","I’d love to bring archery to camp! Archery is a huge part of my identity, but beyond that, it's a unique and fun activity that brings people together who haven't tried it before. It’s incredibly special because it brings people together and unites them with a shared goal: to hit a bulls-eye. It’s almost like an escape since it’s something so unique and immersive. To top it off, the excitement and joy that spreads whenever someone new to the sports hits a bulls-eye is truly priceless. ","I want to volunteer my time for Camp Kesem ultimately for the kids and the campers. I truly want to help these kids be who they want to be. This can mean anything for each of them, and I want to be able to help them understand what this means and become closer to feeling it. Whether it be helping them be honest and vulnerable, spending time with them and showing them someone cares, bringing them back to their childhood, laughing with them, or anything they may want, I want to volunteer to make this happen. 

For me, the experience of learning about family change two years ago had me longing for someone to listen to my thoughts, help me understand my emotions, and feel safe. Knowing that campers younger than me that are growing each and every day are experiencing personal changes and loss, and being able to resonate with how they want to fell safe, loved, and understood makes me want to be a Camp Kesem counselor, to be there for them. Each of the campers, with their unique journeys and stories deserve love and support, and I’d love to be a source of both and more. ","A large part of my identity is learning about my parents’ past at a relatively late age. Around two years ago, I learned about my dad’s affair and how he was later diagnosed as HIV+ due to this encounter 11 years ago, and a pretty heavy explanation of how my mom and dad stayed together to help me and my sister feel like we have a strong family. With this came some discussion of divorce, but what hit me most was how my family was suffering with internal problems but tried to hide them to help me. In Korean culture, there isn’t a lot of talk about emotion and feelings, so there was a huge disconnect on top of all of this. Having been quite a bit of time since, I’m extremely lucky to say that things are better than ever now, but I believe that these experiences have helped me better understand my own emotions, embrace change, and positively reflect. It’s also helped me better understand others and be able to be emotionally available for them. In my daily life, it’s helped me better understand where others are coming from, encourage others to reflect on their experiences, and to be mindful of how people around me feel. I believe that such an experience would contribute to the diversity and depth of experiences that Kesem counselors have had, and equip me with an open mind, compassion, and empathy that I’d love to support the Kesem campers with.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77O6YfbPNLY&feature=youtu.be, (https://hillelatstanford.wufoo.com/cabinet/enlrZWg3azE3amFrMmk=/wuBeEdMwuBerLyFb4%3D/),Sean Chang,11/24/18, (https://hillelatstanford.wufoo.com/cabinet/enlrZWg3azE3amFrMmk=/wuBeEdMwuBerLyFb4%3D/),Sean Chang,11/24/18,11/23/18 21:48,public,11/24/18 0:22,public,128.12.253.7,6,1

I could hear the whimpering and scratching at the door. I went down to see him. As the doorknob turned, my puppy's head cocked sideways and instantly he was no longer upset. I couldn't have my puppy be so sad so I smuggled him into my room and we snuggled all night. This was when my dog and I became best friends. ","1. I love to cook.
I love the spontaneity of going into the kitchen with no plans and just throwing a bunch of food and spices together. There's something beautiful about creating, and my favorite part is sharing my creation. Like, wow, I made this delicious meatball chili and now I'm feeding all my friends too!

*Sexuality: I have experience feeling confused about my sexuality and do not have my sexuality accepted in my family. I understand the sensitivities of the topic and could talk to campers about it.
*Socioeconomic: I didn't identify as low income until I came to Stanford and realized I was low income compared to most people here. Being in a new place with people from different backgrounds can be confusing to personal identity, and I have some experience to be able to discuss that.
*Race: I understand Mexican culture and speak Spanish. I can use this to relate to certain campers and potentially speak a language that would be more comfortable for them.
*Depression: I was depressed from 7th-9th grade and these sad years shaped me and have helped me become happier than ever. I could relate to some campers who might be feeling down and be sensitive with the topic.

My senior year, the grant that my group represented ended up winning our grant!

Role: Senior Leader on the Senior Leadership Team
Dates: 2017-2018 (senior year of high school)
Description: As a member of SLT, I helped my high school with campus tours, information sessions, the freshman, sophomore, and junior retreats, all-school meetings, and our own personal projects, like hosting a penny drive fundraiser. Like many of my other meaningful groups and organizations, I loved being in SLT because I got to be a part of a group that cared passionately about what we were doing, and we got to work as a whole to achieve our goals while each individual did their part. 
","One of my earliest and most favorite memories was what I would consider a perfect summer day when I was probably five or six years old. When I was little, my family lived in Wisconsin, so it was probably 85 degrees out; it was the perfect day to play in the backyard with my neighbors and friends. I remember running around outside for hours in between the various houses nearby, jumping through sprinklers, playing jump rope and hop scotch and soccer, and throwing the ball for my dogs. We would stop for a few minutes to eat strawberries from the strawberry festival we had gone to the day before, then return to the frantic joy of being a kid with nothing planned for the day. Looking back on this memory now, I think I love it so much because it was such a simple time when I had absolutely no worries. There was no technology that we felt obligated to check, there was nothing to stress about with school or activities, and my best friends were all the kids who lived on my street or the street behind me, so it was easy to see them every day. Right now, life is so busy, and the world is so stressful; it’s nice to remember a time when the worst thing that could happen in the world was falling over while riding a bike and scraping my knee. 
","The first thing I would tell you is that I’m a total nerd; I love reading more than anything, and I’ve been obsessed with Harry Potter, Star Wars, and Marvel movies practically since birth. I think I’ve watched every Disney movie in existence, and I know all the words to every song (and still belt along every time I’m in the car). The second thing would be that while I can be outgoing and loud when I need to be, I sometimes prefer to be on the quiet side. I connect well with kids who can need a second to regroup away from the others or who need someone with whom to share something personal; I’m a great listener and comforter. The third thing I would tell you is that I put my entire soul into everything I do. For me, there is no point in joining something if you do not do everything in your power to make it great. With all the activities, groups, and teams I was a part of in high school and hope to join at Stanford, I like to be with a group of passionate people who all want the same thing, and who will be involved and ambitious enough to get it done well. I would be ecstatic to get to join the Camp Kesem community!
","I would be excited to help with arts and crafts projects or facilitate sports games! I loved doing crafts projects as a kid and I played multiple sports throughout high school, so I would love to get to return to my childhood with these kids and help them have a good time. 
","I want to volunteer my time to Camp Kesem because, while I have not had the experience of having a parent with cancer, helping kids have as much of a normal childhood as possible is very important to me. I’ve been fortunate enough to have grown up with a mostly happy childhood with good memories to look back on, and I wish that everyone could have the same. My parents instilled in me a love of service and of loving others, so I’ve been heavily involved in various nonprofits and service organizations throughout middle and high school. This past summer, I interned with a nonprofit called Foster Angels, a group that helps foster kids get the basic necessities as they move from house to house as well as life-enriching experiences like birthday parties or summer camp. I absolutely loved getting to know more about the foster process and getting to help behind the scenes, but I always wished that I could be with the kids directly and in-person. I want to give my time to Camp Kesem to help other kids who are in need or love and support, and I think that I could have a great impact on their camp experience because of all the passion I have for helping them. 
","The main challenge I’ve faced in my background has been reconciling my Catholic faith with my bisexual identity. Growing up and realizing my sexual orientation was confusing and hard, especially since I’ve grown up going to Catholic school for almost my entire life. I pushed down that part of myself throughout high school, and it was only this past summer that I finally reflected on it and felt comfortable accepting it. By now, I have told most of my high school friends and have been very open since coming to Stanford, but I still haven’t told my parents or extended family since they’re very religious and conservative. I think this mix of identities that are both important parts of my life would contribute to the diversity of the counselor community because holding on to two contrasting ideals is something that I’m sure many people go through, but this mix is special and important to me. I think this aspect of my identity would allow me to support the campers because it took me a while to come to terms with my feelings, and I think many campers will be or have already gone through the same thing. Since telling some of my friends about my struggle, they’ve shared their struggles with the same thing, and we’ve been able to help each other through it. I think I could be a great counselor to help the kids with the struggle with their parents, but also with anything else they’re going through. 
","A haiku for you
To show my commitment to
Helping those in need.

I would love to be
A Camp Kesem counselor; 
Please let me help kids!

I write to express
Feelings I can’t say out loud
But still need to share.

I want to help them,
Those who need love and support,
The ones forgotten.

Let them laugh and play
At their home away from home
And be kids again.

Role: Junior Class President, Senior Class Secretary, LEAP coordinator (liaison between the student government class and the special needs students), Student Government 
Dates: September 2015-June 2017
Description: My junior year I felt discouraged by the exclusion of the students with special needs at my school so  worked to create a new position in student government dedicated to including the students with special needs. When I held the position I coordinated events with the special needs students and the student government class, for example secret santa or arts and crafts parties. I also worked to feature special needs student in the rallies. It is now a tradition that sparkles (the special needs cheer team) perform at each rally.
","My favorite childhood memory is not so much one instant, but a happy collection of nights spent safe and loved at home. My mom would read to me and I would lie on the floor and color, sometimes I would braid her hair while she read. Occasionally my brother would color with me, and if I was lucky he would draw me something to color in. I felt content, loved, and carefree.
","-When working with students with special needs, the most important thing is assuming competence, or approaching every person the same, no matter what the visible ability status is.  The term was originally meant to imply that often times just because people with autism or other developmental disabilities may appear to be disabled, their brains work the same way typical brains do. This concept literally changed my life, and it is something I practice not only with special needs communities, but with every new person I meet. I basically have come to learn that people’s exteriors more often than not do not match their interiors. I work hard to treat every person I meet with patience, empathy, and acceptance, understanding that just because people present a certain way does not mean that they truly are that way. 

-I was voted Best Mom by my senior class of  nearly 670. My friends used to joke that so many people confided in me I could take down the whole school with the secrets I held. All joking aside, this is something I take really seriously. It is important to me that I be someone people know they can trust, someone who people can confide in. I work hard to make the spaces I occupy more loving and thoughtful, and perhaps that is “mom-like”, but it is something I am proud of.  

-My name is April, and yes, I was born in April. Also, yes, I play volleyball (you’ll understand when you meet me).  
","I would be really excited to facilitate a guided relaxation, meditation, or gratitude workshop. I am also really interested in the power of storytelling, I believe that storytelling is a powerful therapeutic technique. I would be excited to facilitate a storytelling workshop where the kids could craft their own stories. Lastly I would be excited to teach volleyball. I would be more than happy to teach basic skills, or, run a tournament or more advanced games. 


","Largely because I understand what it is like to have a family member who is ill. I grew up with a brother who had severe mental health issues. He was at his worst when I was in the 4th-7th grade, and because of that I was forced to grow up before I was ready. I felt depressed, angry, hurt, terrified, unsafe, but most of all I felt completely alone. Although I am now thankful for this experience because I have become a more empathetic and compassionate person, it was really difficult growing up. 
	Having a family member with health issues is painful, and while I have never a parent with cancer, I know what it is like to watch a family member suffer. I want to work at Camp Kesem because more than anything, I want to make camp a place where the kids feel safe and loved. I want them to feel like they can talk about what they are going through, because I know how painful it was for me to keep it bottled up inside. I want these kids to have a week of freedom, of feeling absolved from the burden of worry, a week of magic and youthful fun. I know how much worry and mental energy these kids spend on their parents, and I want to work at Camp Kesem to give them a week of joy, and of feeling like what they are going through is not an isolating, but a unifying factor. 
","I mentioned in the previous statement that I grew up with a brother with severe mental health issues. Without going into too much detail, I will just say that a lot of my childhood was consumed with calls to the police, nights spent away from my house because my parents didn’t want me around my brother, and tearful days spent intensely worrying. While I don’t necessarily consider this relevant for many job applications, I feel that it is particularly relevant for this one.

I enjoyed being part of this organization because it allowed me to interact with children who had the desire to better themselves, but just needed a little push to be able to do so. 
Volunteer at Coop Elementary: By being a volunteer at an elementary school, I became aware of the hard work every teacher puts into their lessons to ensure their students have the ability to learn in the best way possible. Not only this, but working with the students was extremely meaningful because they reminded me that age truly does not determine maturity.
Writing Tutor at YES Prep in Houston, TX: Having the ability to tutor my fellow classmates in high school and students in grades below mine reminded me that the saying ""one size does not fit all"" is completely true. Reading their essays and seeing each student's different, but valid perspectives on the same passage was truly enlightening and insightful and exposed the importance of listening to every person's perspective to get the best combination of views on one issue.

For anyone who isn’t familiar with lobstering, it consists of setting traps (filled with bait) connected to a buoy in the ocean, then periodically checking the traps for lobsters and to refill the bait. As a commercial lobsterman, my grandfather had 800 traps, and would check between 200 and 300 each day.

Growing up, I wanted to be just like my grandpa, so I’d spend my summers as his deckhand, steering the boat, re-baiting the traps, and getting sunburned. I’d do push-ups at night in an effort to get strong enough to pull up the traps myself.

The first summer I worked on the boat (when I was 7), I made up a song for when we were hitting a dry-streak and not catching any lobsters.

Here’s how it goes, I’d be happy to sing it for anyone who will listen:
We want a lobster,
just a little lobster!
L-O, L-O-B, L-O-B-S-T-E-R,
LOBSTER, LOBSTER!
Come on, come on, we can get a lobster!

My grandfather and I would sing this repeatedly- getting faster each time- as he pulled up the trap.

When my grandfather died, he left the boat to my cousin and I, and we now have our own set of 100 traps. I cherish our memories on the water, and most of all I cherish our lobster song.","1. I clean up trash when I run. My mom taught me that to be a hero is to act with kindness at all times. I’m most inspired by everyday people who go out of their way to do the right thing when they didn’t have to. That’s why I pick up trash when I see it during a run. That’s why I try to always find the time to do the little things that make a difference.
2. I love laughing at myself. In my graduation speech, titled “Oops Resume”, I told my story of growing up - but through the lens of my 10 most embarrassing moments. Everything from having a voice-crack in front of the student body to leading the entire field of 200 runners at the state championship the wrong way is on that list. I really love self-deprecation and being proud of failure, because that’s how we grow. Also, life is just more fun when I don’t take myself too seriously.
3. I was born on a diner floor. I’m not sure why I want to share this, but I just don’t get to share it often and it’s a cool random fact! The nearest hospital to where I lived in was only open 12 hours per day, and the next closest hospital was too far away. So the community rallied around my mom and helped her through. One of my personal goals is to buy that diner someday and name it after my mom.
","Here’s my two favorite ideas.

1. UKULELE!!! I started playing Uke my senior year. It’s really fun, super accessible to learn (even with 0 musical background), and you can play a ton of songs with only 2-3 chords.
2. Dance-jogging! It’s exactly what it sounds like – you dance and jog at the same time! I saw a video of someone dance-jogging years ago, and I tried it myself. Then I convinced my cross country team to do it on recovery days. It’s great exercise, and it always ends with everyone doubling over on the ground from joy/laughter.
","I’m a proponent of the idea that you can love deeply or love widely. Similarly, I think you can have a big impact on a smaller community, or a thinner impact on a larger community or many communities. I’m much more enticed by the idea of loving and impacting a smaller community deeply, which is why I’m so passionate about wanting to impact the community I came from in Maine. I want to be a public school teacher, and in doing so eventually be able to reform the Maine state education system.

I think there’s no greater gift than helping kids to have the time of their lives, learn more about themselves, and self-actualize through experience, which I know I can help do at Camp Kesem.

On a really personal note, in looking back at my childhood, the people I am most grateful for are the mentors I had during times of struggle for my family, especially those who were there for me when my mom and sisters couldn’t be. In these experiences, I learned that having someone be there for you can make all the difference, and I feel an obligation to help others in similar situations.

I’m so excited about Kesem because I want to learn through experience how to be the best educator, leader, and mentor I can for children. Good teachers help students learn, but great teachers and mentors help kids become their best selves. I want to help students feel comfortable being their best selves.","I now identify as bisexual, but there was a year in high school where I thought I was gay, so I identified as gay. Aside from the internal struggle of having grown up in a homophobic household and subconsciously harboring homophobic sentiment, I also experienced close relationships fizzling because of my identity. The worst explicit bullying came a few days after the Obergefell v. Hodges Supreme Court decision. The school year was just ending, and I was finishing playing pickup basketball after one of my final exams. As I was entering the showers, a hand grabbed my shoulder. “No f*****g way you’re coming in here while I’m showering.” I turned. It was Max, an upperclassman football player who could no doubt squash me beneath his thumb. “Especially now that you can marry,” he continued “you better stay the hell away from me.” I looked over at Eric, one of my best friends who was already showering. We made eye contact, then he pretended not to hear what was going on. I looked back at Max, who wasn’t moving, just pointing at the door. I didn’t like the odds of fighting, so I left, turning around right before I reached the door and flipping Max off. I cried as I biked home, tears streaming down my already-sweaty face.

This incident, and other implicit trauma inform my desire to try to be a friend and ally to anyone experiencing any form of discrimination.","https://youtu.be/9MUzZcuZLQ4

As a Girl Scout, I used to go camping quite regularly, so I have experience building tents, starting fires, and preparing food. I also love hiking because it feels like an escape from the “modern world,” and hiking makes space to reconnect to the people around me as well as understand myself better with respect to nature and my own desires. I have hiked many mountains and trails in SoCal and NorCal, and I have hiked in Colorado. Camping and hiking are essentially at the core of backpacking; through backpacking a group forms a bond that is difficult to break or compare with other forms of friendship, and I would like to help establish these bonds between backpackers and make new friends. I have experience tutoring older children (high school age)."," Piano Teacher and Tutor – Summer 2013 – Present; While I was in high school, I was self-
employed and taught 5 different children how to play beginner piano regularly until I
graduated. When I came to Stanford, I joined the tutoring company Cardinal Scholars and
was connected to 4 more kids who wanted to learn piano and another boy who needed essay and creative writing assistance. I work with children between the ages of 6-16. Overall I have worked with 15 different kids since I started tutoring.
 Volunteer for Rady Children’s Hospital of San Diego – 2013-2014; I worked at a daycare
for children of hospital employees, specifically with children between the ages of 2-5. I
helped set up and plan activities for the teachers, and I supervised and played with the kids
on the playgrounds during the breaks.","I have attended multiple different camps during my childhood, such as surf camp, Girl Scout
camps, and YMCA camps. During these experiences, I took opportunities to lead ice-
breaking activities, such as name-games and general story sharing.
I was also on Green Team in Camp Kesem in 2016."," Former Member of Cardinal Calypso – I joined this group my freshman year of college. I had never had any steel pan experience before, but since I have been a part of the band, I have learned how to play steel pan and perform Caribbean tunes as well as popular songs
adapted for pan.
 Zombie hunter (and occasionally zombie) in Stanford Humans vs. Zombies – Held every
quarter, this is the most intense game of tag to exist. Fully loaded with nerf guns.
 EPATT - I was a weekly tutor for middle schoolers from East Palo Alto. I worked one-on-one with a girl to help her finish her homework and build good organizational skills.","When I was in the second grade, my parents gave me a budgerigar for my birthday. A budgerigar is the formal name for a parakeet: the little, chirpy birds you can buy at any pet store. Little did I know how integral a part of my childhood this budgie would become. I grew closer to Milly, my pet budgie, taking him out of his cage every day to play and letting him sit on my shoulder while I worked on homework. Even though we spent most of our days together, my parents thought Milly was lonely, so one day they purchased another bird, whom we named Lily. Milly and Lily shared the cage, and eventually they became inseparable. I loved watching them interact and sing to each other, but I never expected what came next: an egg sitting at the bottom of their cage!

For the duration of middle school, I continued to breed parakeets; I was even known as the “bird girl” at my school because I was so obsessed with budgerigars. As I started to grow older and the number of parakeets I had in my possession dwindled, I realized that I couldn’t stay a budgie breeder forever, but I would always treasure the memories of raising the little chicks and the lessons I learned from taking care of other living creatures.","The three most important things to me are my friends, my family, and piano.

It is through my friends that I grow as a person; by sharing perspectives and experiences together, I have learned what it means to care for someone you are not related to, and they provide me the support that I need when I deal with family or personal issues. They are also the people that make me feel happiest; when I am with them, I feel a deep sense of joy and belonging.

It is my family that supported me unconditionally and helped me get to the point where I am now. They are also the people that understand me the best (after all, they had all watched me grow up from a baby), and we have endured traumatic events together, which has helped us become more trusting and open with each other.

Piano is an essential part of my life; I started playing piano when I was four years old, and with my knowledge of piano I can share joy and music with the people I care about most, as well as strangers who may simply want to listen.","I would be excited to teach repeat-after-me songs to the kids at camp. I love singing and dancing, so it would fill me with joy to share the energy of these songs.

This may end up being annoying, but I'd like to teach neat tricks for hand whistling (such as the conch hand-clasp whistle or the really-loud fingers-in-mouth whistle).","I can empathize with children of parents who have had cancer. In the summer before I started high school my mom was diagnosed with Ovarian Cancer. This was the first real blow to what I believed was a world where “nothing bad could happen to me or those around me.” Unfortunately, in the midst of my winter quarter freshman year at Stanford, she lost her battle, but left her legacy behind. From her example, I have learned to be as positive as I can possibly be, work hard for my own success and put others’ needs before my own. Even though it was an exceedingly difficult time for my family, I have become a more compassionate, empathetic person who is able to understand the struggles others may go through and provide the support they need. I want to provide the support that children whose parents have fought cancer seek, while serving as a friend who can alleviate the stress that accompanies family illness.

I have been a Kesem counselor before, so I understand how demanding of a task it can be to lead the children at camp, but I admired the strength of the children as well as the kindness of the other counselors. Overall, the Kesem community is filled with immensely positive energy that I would like to be a part of again.","I mentioned my personal experience with my mom's cancer. It had a huge impact on my high school/college career since I had to reevaluate my priorities and learn to process my emotions. College has been very difficult since my mom passed away, but I have new perspective (such as taking a few leaves of absence to try new things like professional dog-washing and virtual reality software development) and I have grown to prioritize the time that I share with my family and friends above everything else because these are the memories that I can carry with me for a lifetime.

Haha just kidding, though I am very glad I'm here. 

My favorite childhood memory was going to India for the first time I could remember. Apparently I lived in India from age 6months-2 years old but that doesn't really count. When I went back at age 7 to visit, I noticed all of the little differences. Obviously, I noticed the general differences in food and standard of living, but what amazed me more was my relatives' priorities. The values were so different. In one house, there were three generations of families living, many having to share rooms. Everyone had everyone's backs and the small squabbles that my family had over things like using the TV or where to eat for dinner did not exist. To be fair, they did not have a TV and fast food chains like McDonald's had not yet popped up yet in the small city, but I think the point still stands. This first trip to India takes the cake as my favorite childhood memory because anything and everything I do today has been, to the best of my ability, in reference to this event and thinking of what should really matters to me. ","1. I am from Phoenix, Arizona.
""It's a dry heat."" But also, it is an awesome state that has taught me to love the outdoors when I can in places like Flagstaff, the Grand Canyon, and random ghost-towns that my friends and like to spontaneously visit. The city is welcoming and the population is diverse, and I hope to translate values I learned within the home at Camp Kesem.

2. I love kids.
I think kids are so interesting. Most of my volunteering experience has been with kids, and I think they are such an awesome group with which to work. It also helps that I am only 19 and am basically still a kid

3. My dad died at age 14 to a heart attack. 
As a kid, my dad used to smoke/drink every day and my biggest fear was that he would get lung cancer. Though he tried to stop on many occasions, eventually his life was cut short any way by a sudden heart attack. ","I would be excited to teach any activity or sport that emphasizes teamwork. This could be basketball, games around a campfire, or something we think of on the spot. I think that when you lose a loved one, it can be very easy to become insular, and kids may have less of a proclivity to share their thoughts and feelings with others. Though this may just be another way to cope, I think that the more that one can talk through life and problems, the easier it becomes to address any other obstacles in the future.","As I stated earlier, kids are an amazing group of individuals with which to work. The kids at this camp have been through more than most people should have to go through in a lifetime; yet, the fact that they want to be here and want to embrace our friendships shows that these kids are something special. Being a kid/teenager is a great time. It is a rare time in life to see the world with wide eyes and ask all sorts of dumb, innocent questions. If allowed to be at Camp Kesem, one of my goals would be to let these kids stay kids for as long as possible.

When my dad passed away, most of my friends said I wasn't the same guy anymore for the entire summer. As a rambunctious eighth grader, I would always be messing around, getting in trouble, and making the wrong jokes at the wrong time (I would like to emphasize that this was me in 8th grade; I swear I am better now). However, after the incident, I became more reserved and less willing to try new things. The next fall, I was lucky enough to go to a welcoming, all-boys high school in Phoenix where  I found my rhythm again, but I know that is not the reality of most people that may lose a loved one. If I can just make one more kid feel welcomed, it would all be worth it.","Thankfully, I have been fortunate enough to live a blessed life. 

There have been a couple of unique moments in my life, starting in 2006. This was the year my little brother Steven was born. Today, he is full of life, always smiling and jamming to music. However, Steven was born with Down's Syndrome and complications related to autism; consequently, Steven will never be able to walk or talk. We communicate through hand-signs mostly but many times, communication is nearly impossible. Communicating with my brother has always pushed me to think of the best way to communicate my thoughts to someone who thinks differently than I do. I would take this same approach to try and communicate to others at the camp in order to best reach them in the way I wish.

Another significant event in my life was my mom losing her job. My mom's a single mom and has been unemployed for two years now. She was laid off after working for fifteen years for the state government. Whatever I make on campus I usually give to tuition, but money has been tight for a long time. This experience has allowed me to be more conscious of my decisions and see a side of life that I would have never expected to see five years ago.","I would like to think of myself as a creative guy, but I have to transition to studying for finals very soon and writing a long overdue paper.

Getting into nature is one of my biggest anxiety relievers and being in the outdoors has helped me countless times when I felt like I needed to clear my head. I also feel like backpacking trips or camping trips in particular bond groups very well. I had no prior camping experience before SPOT. SPOT was incredibly important for me in feeling well balanced and adjusted before getting to Stanford. Though OLP is not the same, I can imagine that being in a smaller group of older campers and counsellors on a backpacking trip will create a lasting effect on us all by putting us in a space beyond Kesem where we can still have meaningful conversations as a unit surrounded by beautiful California nature. "," - As a high school senior I led a student group of eight fourteen-year-olds. We met weekly to 
   learn more about the impact  of micro-donations (e.g. Keva)  
  - I babysat children ages three through eight regularly throughout high school 
  - I am “the best aunt in the whole word” according to my four-year-old niece, Sadie. 
",None,"Over the last four years I have been studying and performing comedic improv at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater in New York City. Last year I formed a group with some of my classmates from the training program. I was the youngest troupe member by eight years. I led a number of our practice sessions and was in charge of booking spaces for our troupe to practice and perform in.

I was very involved with the drama department at my high school. My senior year I was cast as Macbeth in Macbeth and leading up to the performance I met weekly with some of the younger students to help them with their monologues. I also led improv games among the cast and crew that I had learned from UCB to help destress the group and manage anxiety throughout the rehearsal process. 
","My family moved to Rome, Italy, when I was five years old and each memory of my childhood seems tied to some sort of food. Our apartment was in the former Jewish Ghetto, and my daily life revolved around the flavors and smells of fried and baked Roman-Jewish cooking. My favorite memory was when my brother and I raced each other to get to a nearby bakery in the Ghetto before school. The second the front gate of our house closed, we were off. The cold air filled our lungs as we made our way down the winding streets to get to the bakery. After buying our snack we waited together for our bus to school. The daily ritual of going to the bakery with my brother ties me to someone that I care about very much and a childhood centered around food and family. 
","When I was a baby, my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer. Though she has been in remission for over 16 years, the emotional weight of her illness lingers on.  I was ten when I learned my mother had had cancer - my sister whispered it to me like a secret. After a year of silence, I asked my mom to talk about her experience. We spoke all night and she showed me the scars from her mastectomy. It was the first time I had ever seen my mom’s body––her scars embarrass her. I wondered if I carried the same BRCA gene. Over the years, my mom and I have  built a healthy channel of communication and our family experience is one of the main reasons that that I would like to provide support for other young people facing similar challenges. 

Growing up I was a bad listener. Through difficult conversations with my mother, like the one above, and late night talks with my siblings and friends, I have developed communication skills that have made me a more effective leader and better supporter of my friends and family. I learned to ignore the impulse to look for a silver lining or say “I know how you feel.”

My brother, Bluebear (Blue ‘14, Rainbow ‘15), was fundamental in inspiring me to apply for Kesem. He has spoken often about the important relationships that he forged there. Hearing his stories inspired me to try and support such a vibrant and meaningful organization. 

","I would be interested in facilitating drama games. The best improv games pull from childhood play so I have an arsenal ready of games to engage and delight six to sixteen-year-olds. 

I would also be interested in facilitating nature walks and exploring the area around the campground. I am passionate about ecology and would love to share my love of soil with the kids. As a research assistant in a soils lab, I spent most of my time playing in the dirt––a pastime I probably share with many under-ten-year-olds
","If I had known about Camp Kesem when I was ten, I think it would have made a big difference for me personally in coping with my mom's illness. The year I held onto the secret knowledge that my mother had breast cancer, I felt incredibly alone––I felt like I could not talk to my parents, my siblings, or my friends. Kesem provides an often forgotten about group with a space to connect with other kids in similar situations. It gives them an opportunity to communicate how they are feeling while also giving them the liberty to take a break and just be kids for a week. I know how meaningful being a camper at Kesem would have been for me. I can picture what it might have been like––the nerves leading up to my first day of camp, the joy of making a first best friend, and then a second, and then a whole cabin of best friends. So while I didn't have the chance to be a camper, it would be an amazing opportunity to be able to volunteer to be a Camp Kesem counselor and be part of a team that offers kids facing the kind of stresses I can relate to with a secure and supportive environment in which to recharge and have fun.
","I have often struggled with my Jewish identity. Growing up in a predominantly Catholic and sadly often anti-semitic environment was difficult for me as a young Jewish girl. My family was the only Jewish family in the entire school. This childhood experience colored the way I view my Jewish identity today. Though I don’t consider myself religious, I feel very tied to my Jewish ethnicity.

I also identify as queer and this identity has always been relatively muted in my life, though I think it is important I include it here as I would be honored to support any queer campers at Kesem.

In the summers going into freshman year and sophomore year at Stanford I spent the entire summer with the same group of campers, leading hiking trips and fostering leadership skills. My first summer, I was the cabin counselor for a group of seven 14 year old boys meaning that I spent many hours each day interacting with them, discussing with them, and serving as their first point of contact.  

Additionally, both summers I was one of two staff members who went on the longest trip that the camp sends out--5 days of backpacking in the most remote area of the high peaks of the Adirondacks. The second summer I was the leader of this trip, and was singularly responsible for the safety and tone of the trip. I took this opportunity to allow the 6 campers (aged 14 and 15) to have some degree of decision making for the group. They were (in teams of 2) responsible for planning out the schedule of the day. Giving them this autonomy allowed for the development of valuable leadership and outdoor skills.

Additionally, I have taken Outdoor 101 and Wilderness First Aid.","Role: Math Tutor

Role: Trip Leader and Section Head @ North Country Camps (in Keeseville, NY)
Dates: June-August 2017 (Summer after freshman year)
Description: Similar responsibilities as the summer before. However, this summer I was the trip leader responsible for a group of six 14 and 15-year olds for a 5 day trip in remote wilderness. Additionally, I had a cabin of 5 9 and 10 year-olds for the entire summer (7 and a half weeks.) I was also the head of the entire section of youngest campers (boys 10 and younger) and was thus the direct supervisor for 3 other staff members who had cabins of campers of their own.","Role: Residential Assistant (RA) @ Roble Hall

Role: President @ Stanford Windsurfing Club
Dates: September-June 2017, 2018, 2019 (Sophomore and Junior Year)
Description: I am the president of the Stanford windsurfing club.","I spent my whole childhood in a tight-knit community, just north of Chicago. When I was five, we moved one whole block. I helped carry my bed frame down the street. Moving day was like a block party. Ours is an old-fashioned neighborhood where neighbors stop in to borrow eggs and kids of all ages wander into each other’s houses to hang out. 
There were around fifteen kids--all in a five year age range--who lived on my block. When we were young, none of us had real commitments, so every day--provided the weather was nice--we would be outside running around and playing. I was one of the youngest in the group so I learned all sorts of valuable life skills from the older kids like: how to brake your bike slowly enough that you won’t fly off but fast enough that you’ll make an awesome rubber skid, what type of snow is good for making snowballs, and how to make a fort out of tree branches. 
All these learning experiences were phenomenal, but what I remember best is one epic game of wiffle ball. The fence was the first base path, and the sidewalk was the third base line. Pitcher was whoever was oldest, and we raked leaves to form a “mound.” I don’t know how long we were played out there--what seems like hours to me may have been just minutes, but I fondly remember it as if my childhood were a real life Charles Schulz comic.","Asking friends to help brainstorm answers to this sort of question always feels uncomfortably like fishing for compliments, but it is difficult to self identify important characteristics. The three traits they suggested (that I endorse) are that I am enthusiastic, approachable, and dutiful.

 I am usually one of the most excited people in the room. I have recently been mocked on facebook and in real life for saying “that’s crazy” too much--but the truth of the matter is that there are so many stories and things that people say to me that are unbelievable. 

This summer I lived in New York and would routinely get into long conversations with complete strangers on public transit, stores, and restaurants. Sometimes I would initiate it, and sometimes people would come up to me because they thought I looked friendly. My friend alleges it is because I was physically unintimidating and smiled a lot.

The last thing I think you should know about my pragmatism about my role within a group. I am willing to do any job, or take on any role, that I think is “utility maximizing.” As an RA in Roble, depending on which other staff member I am working with, my response to a crisis can either be to be the calming force or the one to escalate concern based on the attitude of my partner. More generally, I tend to be willing to do almost anything if I think that I could do it better than the alternative.",Some of my favorite camp activities to lead all involve exploring and or changing the natural space. These include “nature” in which we walk about identifying areas of interest--such as a long mossy rock pile that probably indicated the boundary of someone’s field once. Another great one is “hydroengineering” where in a deluge of rain campers and I sought to redirect runoff to avoid flooding of key areas. The nature of these activities--dirty and curious--were what made them particularly rewarding--while not to say fun. If windsurfers are present I also would love to teach campers in that activity.,"For two incredibly summers I worked as a camp counsellor. In the two summers since, I have chosen jobs that while more “professionally ambitious” have been less fulfilling. Camp Kesem seems like the most phenomenal opportunity to join an incredible community of campers and staff members.
However, he reason why I am interested in volunteering with Camp Kesem, rather than working at any other summer camp is because the cause hits close to home. I have two moms, and in my life I have had two main male role models, my grandfather and my math teacher, Mr. Freeland. I would routinely have in depth conversations with both of them about life, politics, or just about anything. The two of them passed from cancer within weeks of one another during my senior year of high school. While losing them was nowhere near as difficult as having a parent with cancer, it was still heart-wrenching. With this conceptualization--albeit limited--in mind, I want to do what I can to participate in a supportive community. As a bubbly person with experience working at a camp, I think I could be a net positive on the community of staffers and campers. 
Even if I didn’t think that I was going to have fun, that would be enough to make me want to participate. However, from all appearances, and everything that I have heard from friends, this is the most best week of many people’s year--which makes me want to volunteer with Kesem even more.","As a middle class cisgendered white man, who for a time was majoring in computer science, I do not really bring diversity to the counselor community. However, I grew up in a space that made me think that many marginalized identities were the the norm. I am the son of lesbian mothers, one of whom grew up in rural IL and ran away from home. My younger sibling is non-gender conforming. Growing up, our home was open to any friends who needed a place to stay. I have lived with a cousin with PTSD who went AWOL and a lesbian exterminator with two adopted African-American daughters, among many others.
Although I am someone without an extraordinarily diverse background, I grew up around lots of people who hail from these communities. This level of familiarity and comfort could help me support Kesem’s campers.",https://imgur.com/a/7q9tErr, (https://hillelatstanford.wufoo.com/cabinet/enlrZWg3azE3amFrMmk=/hCBQUPhuwuBe6s%3D/),Zane R Kashner,12/6/18, (https://hillelatstanford.wufoo.com/cabinet/enlrZWg3azE3amFrMmk=/hCBQUPhuwuBe6s%3D/),Zane R Kashner,12/6/18,12/2/18 13:59,public,12/6/18 20:36,public,171.66.208.131,6,1

","I’ll never forget the time I stole my younger sister’s electronic diary. As a 10 year old, I wasn’t as interested in the content of it as much as the opportunity to prank my sister. I remember formulating my plan to outsmart the voice-activated security system the diary utilized, which simply involved waiting outside of her room one night and eavesdropping until I finally heard the password. Then one day, when she was at a soccer game, I stole the diary from her drawer and repeated the password into it. I didn’t realize that the diary was only supposed to respond to her voice, but luckily, because it was cheap and my voice was high at that age, I was able to unlock her diary. I was in.

Once I held in my hand my 8 year old sister’s deepest secrets, hopes, and insecurities I pondered reading them. Of course not... I was scared of girls. I did, however, reset her password to something completely different and then waited outside her door that very night. It only took a couple of minutes of waiting before I heard her yell in frustration when the diary locked her out after too many failed attempts. This moment was gratifying on its own, but  the best satisfaction came from the look on her face when I walked into her room, pointed at the diary, and admitted that I had cleverly changed her password. How I did it still remains the biggest mystery between us.
","Firstly, know that I grew up as the middle child with two sisters and have derived a significant part of my personality and habits from this role. Without anyone to “roughhouse” with, I instead grew up drawing, playing with dolls, and following my older sister around. Because of this, I learned to exercise emotional vulnerability and empathize with my peers as my sisters and I would talk about our feelings openly. Surprisingly, I am the most sensitive in my family and the one most interested in clothes and fashion as well.

Secondly, one of my strongest and proudest traits is my thoughtfulness. I am constantly aware of how my actions affect those around me and am willing to sacrifice my own time and enjoyment for others. I’m the friend who is always willing to give you a ride, who picks you up food before you even ask, and who checks in with you if you seem a little out of it. I firmly believe that small gestures like this that can entirely change a friend’s day or even week.

Lastly, I want to share the fact that I can’t handle any type of spicy food. At Chipotle, I can only get the mild salsa- basically just tomatoes- which still makes me turn red and start sweating when I eat it. My mom loves making salsa at home and reluctantly makes a special, weak version that only I use and am made fun of for amongst family.
","Two activities which immediately came to mind are a soccer tournament and a bread bake. At Sierra Camp, I led a weekly bread bake where the camp chef would prepare the dough, and I would guide a group of about twenty guests in braiding the bread and then decorate it with a variety of toppings and a layer of egg wash. I have also played and coached soccer my entire life, and would love to organize a soccer tournament among the kids. I am not sure about Kesem's resources, but could facilitate either activity at camp.","I spent the last summer at Sierra Camp getting my heart broken every week.

More specifically, every week I fell in love with the kids I was counseling and then was crushed when I said goodbye to them. It was the best summer of my life.

I loved every aspect of working with children, from dressing up every Monday as as a cow to fit the space cow theme we created to teaching the kids about consent using hugs. I especially liked working with the younger kids because I could match their physical energy and connect with their silly sense of humor. Unexpectedly, I also valued the person I became around the kids- I was extremely goofy, energetic, and inspiring, contrasting my usual, easy-going nature.

Because I can’t commit this upcoming summer to Sierra Camp, Kesem is my best and only opportunity to work with kids and to be that person once again. 

The most rewarding experiences I had at Sierra Camp were the serious moments with the kids, ranging from a boy getting injured and crying to a young girl stating out of nowhere that her parents were getting divorced without really understanding what that meant. Handling these situations required the utmost patience, sincerity, and understanding, and gave me the chance to really make an impact as a counselor. Kesem requires this same delicacy and sensitivity, and presents an opportunity for me to change the lives of a group of kids and get my heart broken one more time.
","My life is a contrasting and even opposing blend of Mexican and American traditions. Both my parents are immigrants from Mexico, so our household is full of Mexican traditions and customs, but by growing up and going to school in Southern California, I have also been immersed in American culture. My first language was Spanish, but now my English has far surpassed my Spanish-speaking ability. I don’t completely know my place within each culture, but still consider both to be part of my identity. My parents and household have taught me to be hardworking, loyal, and cautious while my environment and experiences have taught me to compassionate, accepting, and hopeful. This, along with a multicultural understanding, is the perspective I bring to the counselor community.

On a separate note, the final week of Sierra Camp was reserved for middle schoolers from low-income communities in East Palo Alto. The majority of these campers happened to come from Spanish-speaking and Mexican communities, and hearing their stories and being able to relate to the communities they came from allowed me to really connect with the kids. By the end of the week, the kids I was assigned to were all striving to go to Stanford and looked up to me because of our common background. My counseling was made that much more effective because they saw themselves in me. I can fundamentally connect with any campers coming from similar backgrounds, communities, or cultures, serving as a role model and a friend.

","I know this isn’t exactly one specific favorite childhood memory, but many of my happiest memories occurred on my weekly family outings to the Happy Hollow Park and Zoo in San Jose. I loved skipping through the little zoo, eating a picnic lunch with my family, and racing down the slides on the playgrounds—even back then, I was a little bit of an adrenaline junkie. At some point, I named the resident jaguar Sally, even though there was a plaque with the jaguar’s official name on it. 

Happy Hollow was a place where I could just be a kid, running around and experiencing life carefree. 
","1. Don't expect me to be a casual observer of anything. My all-in personality works on multiple levels—you'll find me obsessing over Yuzuru Hanyu’s quad-salchow just as readily as phylum Tardigrada.  

2. I'll admit it, I am a huge fangirl. Like, cosplay and freak out / camp out for Comic Con panels level. 

I approach the world through the lens of my fandoms, carrying with me the literature I love, the soundtracks I hum, and the characters I ""stan."" Being a fangirl comes complete with its own universe and lexicon. Nothing is unrelated, and the world takes on a colorful, fantastical quality in the connections between fiction and reality. Scenes from a comic book universe are lifted off the page into our current events. 

Being a fangirl is like suiting up—suddenly, I am more. I am the Atom, working at the molecular level to impact people's lives on a grand scale. I am Iron Man, using engineering and design to change the world. 

Maybe this explains why I’m still a child at heart. Fangirling is the hyperfocus of an imagination at play—without missing a single adventure. 

3. I love face paint! Wow, how am I even 18 years old? 
","Music has always been one of my greatest passions, and I’ve enjoyed most being able to share this with others. I have experience teaching music to the children in the orphanage I volunteer at and would love to do something similar at camp. 

I play piano, guitar, and some ukulele—with some acceptable but not very amazing accompanied singing. At camp, I could teach any of these instruments in either formal or informal settings. I’d also be really interested in facilitating campfire sing-along activities or talent shows. Basically, if there’s anything involving music, I’m in! 

","Before he left for bootcamp, Justin gave me just one request—that I apply to work at Camp Kesem. 

Our group of friends was getting ready to scatter across the country for college. Justin, despite the wishes of family and friends, had decided to postpone college and enlist straight out of high school. This was a decision that we all struggled to come to terms with, and made saying goodbye just that much more difficult.
I never knew that Justin had had a parent with cancer, or that he was a Stanford Camp Kesem alum. But when he told me about his camp experience and said he was sure I would love being a counselor, I felt incredibly thankful that he, as a pretty private individual, had trusted me with his story. 

To me, this felt like a parting gift. And, in a sense, I feel like I owe it both to him and myself to at least try. My parents fortunately have not had cancer, but cancer has left a lasting impact on my family. Several years ago, my family pulled me out of school for months and returned to China when my grandpa was diagnosed with late-stage lung cancer. The feeling of helplessness that ties together everyone impacted by a diagnosis is something that I have not been spared from. 

As I looked into Camp Kesem before arriving at campus, I fell in love with its mission—helping create a haven for these kids would be incredibly meaningful to me. 
","As an upper middle class Asian American from the Silicon Valley, I deeply recognize the relative privilege that my background gives me compared to many others. 

The most personally challenging aspect of my identity so far has thus probably been my sexual orientation. Even in high school, despite attending a professedly liberal school, I did not feel at all comfortable with coming out. Since arriving at Stanford, I have been open about my bisexuality, but I am still not so with my family or community at home. Identifying as LGBTQ+ is still not exactly supported within the Asian American community. I think I can support LGBTQ+ campers here who also come from backgrounds (especially minority ones) where expressing their true identity is incredibly challenging.

Role: Facility Volunteer @ Morningside of Macon
Dates: 2014 - 2018
Description: I used to volunteer every single week at Morningside of Macon Assisted Living Residence. Developed meaningful connections with the senior citizens, developing “brain games” such as trivia and bingo to help mitigate their neurodegenerative disease progressions, reading stories, and other activities. Helped serve meals, talked to residents when they were lonely, and taught residents how to operate a computer. ","My family, along with a handful of families from our hometown, went on a Caribbean cruise one Thanksgiving break. Interestingly, all of the kids on the trip were about my age (ranging from ages 12-14). Initially, it seemed that I would never even talk to these kids—these strangers I had never met before—during the course of the trip. That common, middle school disease of intense shyness was present in all of us. Yet starting from that first evening in Florida, before the cruise even departed, it seemed that these other kids my age were cool people after all. Quite quickly, that awkward “barrier” broke down between all of us, and we would end up playing basketball, frisbee, hide-and-seek and so many other games together during the trip.

Although the entire trip was fantastic and full of memories that I cherish to this day, one specific moment that stands out was when we all went kayaking on an extremely windy afternoon. Trying to kayak against the wind was quite possibly the most intensive shoulder exercise that I have ever done. Now, what was most fun about this experience was NOT the pain in my shoulders, but rather, the sheer exhilaration of trying to kayak as quickly as possible to reach the warmth (and the delicious food) of the cruise ship. That shared experience of trying to defeat the common obstacle—that stupid wind—is something we all talk about even today.","I love to teach and work with children. Having worked with various age groups (ranging from little kids to high schoolers to senior citizens) in a host of different settings, I have found that communication is a skill that I enjoy and something which I’m on a never-ending quest to improve. Specifically, communicating with kids is one such activity which I have found to be so rewarding. Kids’ sheer energy and unbridled enthusiasm for learning new things, for delving into activities head-first without a second thought—this is what makes working with them so contagious. The sheer malleability of a kid’s ambitions and aspirations gives me a motivation to be a positive mentor in their lives and to help them overcome whatever struggles they may be experiencing.

I notice really small details. Although I’m meticulous and pay attention to minutia in my work, I think I’m also somehow able to pick up on subtle emotional cues. For example, I can sense emotions such as happiness and sadness even when someone tries to cover them up, and I think this has allowed me to really empathize and communicate with people on a much deeper level.

I come from a small town in Georgia. Coming from an area of quite limited opportunities has made me motivated to support kids in unfortunate circumstances. My experiences teaching CPR in my hometown has also made me all-the-more understanding of other people’s situations, giving me a unique perspective as a peer educator. 
","I would love to teach CPR and basic life-saving skills, incorporating my love for education and skills as an American-Heart-Association certified BLS-Instructor and EMT-in-training. Through fun, quick, and interactive classes, I could equip kids with skills to save a life during emergencies.

Additionally, I would love to teach kids on a more personal level, highlighting the importance of finding healthy balances in life and healthy ways to overcome struggle. I think day-to-day tips and re-encouragement, strategies to manage stress, ways to build friendships, and other personalized “childhood advice” is what I would love to facilitate at Camp Kesem.","Cancer has been a part of my life for the past 6 years. When I was in the 7th grade, my cousin was diagnosed with anaplastic large cell lymphoma, a rare type of cancer. Watching him having to take time off from university in order to go through chemotherapy and seeing how he suffered during those years made me understand the realities of living with such a deadly disease. Not only did he ache, but his mom, his dad, his little brother, his whole family suffered. During this time, I learned to appreciate my own health which I had been taking for granted all those years prior. Luckily, my cousin successfully overcame the cancer and is now in remission. But seeing a family member experiencing cancer at such a young age made me realize how many other people are not so lucky.

At Camp Kesem, I would have the opportunity to work with children whose parents are afflicted with cancer. I totally understand the concept of how when a family member gets cancer, the whole family suffers. Providing a positive, hopeful example for these kids in such a vulnerable, formative time in their lives (especially with cancer creating such a big family stress) is something I would love to get involved with.  And more personally, volunteering at Camp Kesem would provide me with a self-satisfaction of knowing that I’m playing a part in erasing the emotional scars caused by cancer for these children.
","Growing up as a South Asian minority in a small, rural town in Georgia was quite an unusual experience. While many of my classmates went deer-hunting, fishing, and ATV mudding on weekends, I was playing piano and shooting hoops. The lack of shared interests and sometimes blatantly-obvious cultural differences between me and my classmates sometimes made me feel as if I was different, an outsider. Yet I learned to adapt. I learned to fit in with my friends while not compromising the ethnic assimilation of my Indian culture. I learned to balance my own values with understanding the values which they had.

Similarly, many of the Camp Kesem kids may feel like an “outsider” due to their personal family crisis. I think my version of this experience has given me a crucial insight into what I would try to teach and impress upon the campers at Camp Kesem: to recognize their unique situation, and to grow stronger from it.  Trying to turn these unfortunate circumstances into a source for growth, individuality, and personal empowerment is what I hope to help with.
","Here is a small poem I wrote regarding my ambition to join Camp Kesem’s counselor staff. Written in the style of Emily Dickinson, this poem metaphorically highlights my own personal journey from being shy and reserved to slowly breaking out of my shell. Although it might be a tad bit sappy, at the heart of the poem lies the fact that I want to help other kids with their own personal aspirations, to give them a sense of confidence to overcome their struggles—and I think Camp Kesem is the perfect platform for me to do so.
 
 
Reticent Thoughts
By Tejas Athni
 
He walks alone in the blissful night—
In the shade of the olive tree.
Piercing chill of the wintry wind
Not a single sight to see.
 
Packed with the rapid highway
Of starry-eyed thoughts—
Rushing ever so rapid and quick
His mouth, they forgot.
 
And then something clicked a switch—
A net that seemed to release.
The world opened up for him—
His thoughts, begged to cease.
 
Expressions flowed from his lips
Like water from a fall.
Breaking from his reticent shell—
Camp Kesem was his call.

I am relatively young, therefore it may be easier for me to connect with these teens. OLP focuses a lot on team-building and leadership- skills that I have learned through my many years playing team sports both in high school and outside. Another reason why I am interested in OLP is due to the common ground these teens and I may find. When I was a sophomore in high school, my mother was diagnosed with cancer. I may not have any prior experience with this age group or with the outdoors, but I have an idea of what can go through the minds of people form this age group who have a parent affected by cancer.

","Growing up, my mom read the Harry Potter series out loud to my brothers and myself, over the course of many years. Basically every night during elementary school, I laid on my parent’s bed, cuddled up with my brothers and near my dad, who worked while listening in, to hear about Harry’s adventures; we grew older alongside the characters. Every summer, when I re-read the series, I can hear my mom’s killer Hagrid impression, and I can hear her voice choking up as she would read each of Dumbledore’s speeches. 

By the time the seventh Harry Potter book came out, we had all been anxiously waiting for the release for months. Even though we were in the middle of a family vacation at the beach, the day it was released my mom drove us all to a bookstore in this random town to get a copy, and we spent the remaining three days of our precious summer vacation time plowing through the harrowing end of the books. My love for reading was ingrained in me through this Harry Potter bonding experience, and my whole family can divulge into long conversations at the dinner table about the plot twists of the series. 
","This past summer, I spent many hours trying to teach myself guitar! I took piano lessons for many years, and love to sing, but until recently I had zero experience with guitar. However, my brother dutifully taught me chords and strumming patterns for several months. It doesn’t come super naturally to me (I have tiny hands and piano makes more sense visually) but it’s been a really cool challenge to learn.

My dad is an architect, and he designed the house we currently live in around based on my family’s structure and our personalities. My relationship with my house runs much deeper than just a sense of home and familiarity because I was able to help build it from the foundation up, quite literally. It is a unique experience to install a radiant heating system in a basement, or to help sand the flooring for the kitchen. Not only did my family truly labor in the building process, but the layout represents the openness and warmth my family presents to anyone who walks through the door. My house is a genuine representation of the practicality and compassion of my parents and brothers possess; my feelings of home are deeply rooted in my feelings of belonging to my family.

I am running out of words so fun fact: I didn’t know reindeer were real until I was 14. I thought they were mythical creatures (just saying...nobody ever talks about reindeer unless they’re also talking about Santa...who is make-believe...).
","This past summer, I witnessed so many of my campers break out of their comfort zones when  put in front of an instrument. I would love to facilitate a jam-session music group where kids can practice playing instruments, writing music, and performing for other campers. Music is a wonderful outlet, but it can be intimidating if you don’t have a ton of experience with an instrument. If I were to work with a little jam-session group, I would be able to demonstrate how putting your own vulnerabilities aside and genuinely just trying to enjoy the music is pretty awesome! 
","When I was in elementary school, my 7 year old cousin was diagnosed with Stage 4 bone cancer. For 16 months he dealt with many surgeries and treatments, but eventually passed away on my first day of 5th grade. We visited him in the hospital throughout his treatments, but as a young child, I had no idea how to comprehend what was happening, or how to grieve his death. The entire process was confusing and saddening, and yet I didn’t know how to talk to my friends about it. 

A year later, I learned my mom had breast cancer; my only cancer experience prior was so devastating that I immediately assumed the same kind of gruesome treatment and eventual death would overtake my own mother as well. Again, I was terrified and sad, but luckily her cancer was Stage 1, Level 1; within five months she was in remission and she’s been healthy since. 

I want to volunteer at Kesem because I know what it is like to be a young child dealing with experiences that are difficult for even adults to process. I can empathize with the experience of realizing that those closest to you - those who you are born to believe will always be there to protect you - might one day not be there. That kind of fear is deeply unsettling for a child; in those times, I needed a well-crafted retreat like Kesem, so I want to volunteer to provide that experience for other children. 
","I have always cared about issues of gender and sexuality - in high school, my friends and I started and led a discussion-based club about gender issues in the world - and how they interfere with the political world. Particularly in my experience of working with young children and looking so intimately at the ways that they are socialized to adhere to certain gender and sexuality standards, I have been intrigued by thinking about how to push children to think outside common societal norms of sexuality binaries. 

I am a pretty extroverted person, but throughout college I’ve started to really think deeply about my own sexual identity; I feel lucky to have grown up in a household and school environment where I was so comfortable with myself, but coming to Stanford and meeting people with such vastly different experiences than mine has made me think more introspectively about how sexuality is interpreted. Particularly in this past year, I’ve been struggling with figuring out how to talk to my closest friends and family about the ways in which assumptions about sexuality can be really limiting, and how I don’t fit into these common assumptions. It’s not something I’m super comfortable being open about yet, but I’m working on it!
",I am uploading a picture of a Mega Friendship Bracelet I made at camp over the summer!

For the past two summers, a group of six friends and myself have organized four day backpacking trips, once to Emigrant Wilderness and once to Sequoia National Park. These outings taught me not only the more practical aspects that come with executing such a trip (packing lists, Venmo, and tent flys are your friends), but how the simplicity and isolation of the wilderness can truly bring out the best in people. Activities are limited and endless at the same time, forcing you to use your imagination and dig deep into the intricacies of all the people and sights that surround you. I can’t think of an environment more conducive to building relationships – a couple card games or wrong turns later and you feel like you have known each other for years. 

I have wanted to gain more training in outdoor leadership for some time now, and I would be so incredibly excited to have the opportunity to do so for Camp Kesem. I believe that my enthusiasm for the outdoors would be contagious, and that I would be successful in fostering an environment that allows for adventure as well as introspection.

In this position, I acted as a liaison between the students and teachers, had a say in the curriculum of classes, and organized various speakers and field trips related to our learning. For example, we created book clubs within our English class, organized a trip to SF MOMA, and brought in a photojournalist who photographed the Rohingya refugee crisis. 

","Tuesday afternoons were my favorite. The bell rang, and Stella and I would greet one another in front of the flagpole with smiles that missed several teeth. It was two o’clock, and our five o’clock soccer practice felt lifetimes away. How would we spend these lifetimes, ripe for the picking?

The answer varied week to week, with the exception of one constant: mac n cheese. We stacked stools to bring our eyes above the stove, where we blew the rising steam as if we were dragons. Dividing the cheesy treasure was perhaps the climax of the afternoon, one of us would carefully count spoonfuls into two identically sized bowls while the other watched with laser focus, waiting to pounce upon their portion. 

What came next was dependent on the state of the sky. Sun meant sprinklers and spraying the hose, dancing through misty rainbows while Benson barked and chased his tail. Sun meant daring each other to eat the unknowns of the vegetable garden, once I dared Stella to eat a worm and she actually did! I was proud and jealous simultaneously. 

Clouds brought mischief, rain even more so. Our first order of business was to make Quincy, her older brother, as bothered as humanly possible. Crouched underneath the grand piano, we tried to tickle his feet as he pressed at the pedals.

When five o’clock rolled around, neither of us were ever sad to leave our playground. The end of our Tuesday afternoons felt lifetimes away. 
","I give everything a chance. Whether that be a genre of music, a class, or a conversation, I am open to pretty much all variations of experiences. This life approach isn’t a way to collect stories, but to live through all of the unexpected joy and grounding humility that new things can bring. My open-mindedness is one of my favorite parts of myself! 

I am happiest when I am outside. The way light shines through the leaves of trees and all of the colors the sky can take puts a cheesy grin on my face. 

Above all else, I value genuine kindness. I like asking people about their days and the music they’ve been listening to, and a large part of my brain is devoted to storing their answers; I will drop most things for a nice heart to heart with a friend. I would like to think that these practices make those around me feel valued and seen in the way they wish to be. 
","I love friendship bracelets! When I was ten I watched about thirty YouTube tutorials, all teaching different patterns, and took very diligent notes in a notebook I still have to this day. I adopted the role of instructor in many of the camps I attended, so I am quite confident in my ability to teach others and I’m excited to see what the campers could teach me. I find making friendship bracelets to be an excellent medium for conversation, and I would enjoy the opportunity to casually converse with campers while helping them create a unique memento. 
","Growing up, I remember being very aware of the distinction between the adults who mocked my thoughts and the ones who took them seriously. From my experiences babysitting and tutoring, I know that kids can say some pretty odd things; yet, they are often so bravely characteristic. I have a deep respect for the observations of children, and I believe that fostering their quirks is one of the most helpful things an older figure can do. I babysat Ayden for two years, and our conversations spanned a wide range of topics including his fear of refrigerators, his love of his six fish, and his confusion with why he was made fun of when he wore nail polish to school one day – I remember him saying “It’s fun to watch it glitter in the sun!” with a big smile on his face. While I would like to think that I helped Ayden understand his feelings and encouraged his interests, I can say with confidence that he taught me things too, such as the location of a secret blackberry patch in our neighbourhood, how everything can be funny if you want it to be, and how to best comfort his younger brother Tristan when he cried. At Camp Kesem, I want to be a loving and energetic figure for more children, someone they can giggle with or vent to, because I remember how happy and fulfilled those figures made me feel when I was younger. 
","My father is Italian and my mother is Iranian, making me first generation American. This has been an incredible aspect of my life – I’ve been exposed to mindsets that many are not. However, this mishmash of cultures can feel isolating. We have no religious community, there aren’t many Italians around, and my European features sometimes exclude me from the Iranian community (at the Persian new year parties we attend annually I am often mistaken for a tag-along American friend). On the Fourth of July or Super Bowl Sunday, I feel aware of how un-American we are – the hot dogs we prepare and the block parties we attend feel like a disguise that my parents don’t enjoy wearing. 
	My appearance allows me to blend in rather easily, so I don’t experience the downsides of my background daily. But when prompted to ponder my identity, I’m at a loss. People often ask me: which community do you feel most devoted to or a part of? However well intentioned, this question frustrates me to no end, largely because it forces me to admit the cultural gray space in which I exist. 
I wouldn’t compare this experience with that of the campers at Kesem, but it has certainly given me an understanding of what it is like to reconcile a confusing and invisible identity with a seemingly incongruent visible one. I believe that this understanding would enable me to better empathize with campers, and would inform my approach to sensitive conversations.

My conversations during these walks were always extremely inspirational. Despite her disabilities, Nina is cheerful, ambitious, and optimistic. I helped her to exercise and gave her someone to talk to, and in turn, I learned that it’s possible to both acknowledge your weaknesses and refuse to let them hinder your personal growth. 

Role: Member of Belmont High School's Student Senate
Dates: January 2016 - June 2018
Description: Student Senate was a community of students of all four grades that worked to improve communication between teachers and students.  One of the major projects I worked on in this group was a teacher shadowing initiative in which teachers had the opportunity to shadow a student during his or her school day in order to experience a student’s perspective.  The program ran during my senior year, and based on the positive feedback we received from teachers, I hope that the program helped to lessen the divide between teacher and student perspectives.

Role: Exhibit Hall Interpreter at the Boston Museum of Science
Dates: April 2016 - August 2017
Description: As mentioned earlier, I worked with children at a local science museum. My job there wasn’t to teach an experiment, but rather to interpret it. I focused the visitor’s exploration and helped tease meaning from his or her observations and ideas. In response to “why?”, I asked “how would you find out?”, and when faced with “what if?”, I replied “why don’t you try?”. This manner of teaching was incredibly impactful because it emphasized risk-taking and experimentation and taught children that their ideas are valid, even when working with an unfamiliar subject.","   One of the families that lived near my childhood house had a trampoline in their backyard that had been abandoned ever since their kids, who were many years older than me, had left for college.  My neighbors gave me permission to use the trampoline whenever I wanted, and as a result, my best friend and I spent hours bouncing around almost every afternoon while in elementary school. 
    I have distinct fond memories of running home from school, dropping our backpacks in my bedroom, and them scampering across the street and through my neighbor's yard before eagerly climbing onto the trampoline.  My friend and I made up our own games to entertain ourselves.  Some of these activities had extremely complex rules, and others were as simple as  choreographing dances to our favorite songs or seeing who could do more front flips in a row.
    Regardless of which specific activity we took part in, those afternoons on the trampoline always remind me of the innocent joy of childhood and the power of a great friendship. The games that my friend and I played on the trampoline felt like something special and unique to us, and I think that sharing those afternoons together is part of what cemented our friendship, which still exists today. ","1.  I’ve often struggled with my naturally quiet disposition. When I was younger, I often felt as though the world equated the volume of a person’s voice to his importance.  Even at Stanford, I sometimes feel uncomfortable because I struggle to cheer loudly or immediately introduce myself to new people. When I went to day camp, my counselors were always loud and outgoing, and I often interpreted their behavior as an unspoken suggestion that I should act the same way.  I think it’s important to show kids that personalities other than the classic extroverted counselor are not only acceptable but valuable. 
2. My childhood obsession was the Titanic.  Not the movie; the literal sinking of the ship. I've never been one to back down from the darkest parts of the world.  I think that it's incredibly important to discuss painful and uncomfortable topics. These conversations are difficult, but I believe that when we acknowledge and talk about the worst that the world has to offer, it makes us more appreciative of all the good the world holds. 
3. Although I never went to sleepaway camp, many of my friends did, and they always spoke of their time away from home as a genuinely magical experience. I've always worried that my decision not to attend camp means that I've missed out on a truly life-changing and inexplicable experience.  I would love to enter the remarkable world of camp as a counselor and finally understand just how incredible it can be. ","   When I was little, my dad made up stories to tell me before bed.  Sometimes, he would let me decide small details that influenced the story's direction. I loved the special feeling of power that came from controlling the tale, even if I was only altering a minor detail.
   I think it would be cool to facilitative a similar activity at camp.  I could tell campers a story, and let them participate by providing details that influence the story's direction. Sometimes camp can be exhausting, and this would be a good low-energy activity that still gives campers some agency. ","     When I was in elementary school, my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer.  The doctors caught the disease early, my mom went through chemotherapy, and now she’s completely healthy.
     The process confused me more than anything else.  I knew that my mom was more tired than she used to be and that her hair fell out and she had to wear a wig. I knew what cancer was, but it was a big and scary word, and I tried not to think too much about it. 
     I didn’t tell any of my friends that my mother was sick. I felt like my fear was invalid because I always knew that my mom would get better, and so many other families don’t have that luxury.  Still, I was horrified by how weak my mom looked and how little control I had over what was happening. 
     During this time in my life, I think a program like Camp Kesem would have been so valuable. If I had been part of a community of kids struggling with similar issues where I was encouraged to reflect on my feelings, I would have been better equipped to navigate the mature and complex issues I was facing.
    I want to volunteer for Camp Kesem because I want to help other children have the community and outlet that I didn’t have.  Cancer is really, really hard.  Kids deserve a place to be happy, to be young, and to receive support for the struggles they’re undergoing.  ","    As I mentioned earlier, my mom was diagnosed with Stage 1 Breast Cancer when I was in third grade.  She went through chemotherapy and is now in remission and has been for several years. Although my mother’s situation was a less severe case than most instances of cancer, I do understand a little bit of what it’s like to see a parent in a weakened state and to feel helpless to change anything. I believe that I can use my own family history to speak to campers about their own parents' illnesses and the many complicated feelings they may be struggling to accept and understand.  ","     Something that has always been very important to me is remembering the important and influential moments of my past, whether they are good or bad.  From what I understand about Camp Kesem, this is something that is important to campers and counselors there as well; the ability to discuss one’s feelings about past or present events, honor the memory of people or places that are no longer in one’s life, and learn from our histories is essential to the camp's goals.
	One of the most rewarding ways for me to practice this type of recollection and self-reflection is through photography.  Below I have included a link to an album that contains a couple of photographs that I have taken that remind me of important people and moments in my life. Each of these images depicts a snapshot of a person or place that was important to me and helped shape me into who I am today.  At Camp Kesem, I hope to be able to collect many more of these moments, and perhaps even capture some of them on film.

Role: Emergency Medical Teacher @ Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania
Dates: June 2018
Description: I worked teaching communities about emergency response without access to hospitals, working specifically with younger girls and expectant mothers on child health.",I have not worked in a camp.,"This past summer, I taught English and emergency medicine in Tanzania, and I realized that the most effective way of doing service was by supporting the individuals teaching first-aid response in their own communities. I supplemented the curriculum these teachers taught from, providing in-depth pathophysiological information about the medical procedures while they instructed. Also, as the only female EMT, I also worked directly with female patients and young girls.

As an upperclassman at my boarding school in Amman, Jordan, I worked as an RA in a freshman dorm, supporting freshman experiencing difficulties like homesickness, academic struggles, and social adjustments. I lived with them and was a big part of their social support. What that experience made me realize is a that key part to being a friend is simply being a witness. Often, nothing can be said to remedy a situation, but simply being present with someone can help. 

Being a SHPRC counselor has been the most meaningful organization I have been in this year. When I came to Stanford, I was exposed to an environment in which sex was something to openly talk about, embrace, and celebrate in a healthy way, and I learned how to approach these conversations in a positive way. I realized I was in a unique position to help other people. I’m a calming presence for people sometimes in real crisis, ranging from questions about birth control to possible pregnancies and sexual assault and give them the information and support they need. ","When I was little, I climbed everything I could. Living in a big city, I climbed onto the top of our house and monkeyed onto neighboring houses, peering into windows and watching the streets below me. Mostly, I loved the enormous tree that commanded the backyard. It was the perfect climbing tree, a huge trunk with branches a couple meters off the ground. It was my stomping ground. I would bring my homework, meals, even sleeping bags up into the tree for hours, listening to strangers’ conversations. One day, my dad came up, and to his shock, saw me suspended over twenty feet up in the air. It dawned on him that it might not be the best idea to have his ten-year-old up there. I braced myself for a scolding, but to my shock, the opposite happened. My dad and I drove to a sporting goods store and spent an hour picking out different kinds of rope and harnesses. We finally settled on a bright orange one. He taught me about carabiners and knots, all skills his dad had taught him, and when we came home, he set up the ropes in the tree so that at any moment, I could grab my harness and go up into the tree. Instead of punishing me, he let me pursue something that I really loved. I spent as much time as I could up in those branches, only being stopped when the harness didn't fit me any more. 
","Last winter, my mom was diagnosed with lung cancer and needed surgery to remove part of her lungs to prevent it from spreading. The process moved quickly, and for a while it was hard to be present with such a looming worry over me. I felt like even my closest friends could not understand what I was feeling then and the worries I still have now about her health. I cannot compare myself to someone who has lost a parent to cancer or has had to endure it for a long time, however I can deeply empathize with the frustration and pain this experience can impose. 

Moving around a lot while growing up made me have strong emotional attachments to relationships, rather than places or things. My relationships are the single most important thing in my life. I will put my friends above anything else. This is not always a good thing. I will sacrifice my grades, sleep and mental health for the people in my life and can define myself by my interpersonal relationships. 

If being at college wasn’t absolutely necessary, I’d be in the West Bank working to mend the Palestinian-Israeli conflict right now. The Palestinian-Israeli issue is probably the single issue I care the most about. I’ve witnessed it firsthand and experienced it through the lives of my friends. I often wonder why I am pursuing a degree when there is so much real work I could do in this conflict.","When I tell people I speak Arabic, a response I get is “I know how to write my name in Arabic!” Somewhere, somehow, they learned to write their name and are very proud of it. There is something about the foreign script, the curvy lines and funky letters that people love seeing their own name in. Unlike some other languages, the Arabic script is easy to learn. I would want to teach campers how to write their name and the basic letters. The opportunity to teach about other cultures, especially Arab culture, through language, is one I would absolutely love.
","Camp Kesem is a unique opportunity to accompany children and walk alongside them in one of the hardest and most painful experiences they may have. It is an opportunity to make them feel less alone by not only having counselors to talk to but also having a community of other children who have experienced this profoundly unique experience. While I was much older when my mother was diagnosed with cancer, I vividly remember the experience of being surrounded by people I felt had no idea what I was going through. I was scared and felt very alone in this circumstance, and I was eighteen at the time. I cannot imagine how a child must feel. Kesem provides children with space to openly talk about their feelings with other children who share their experiences and with counselors who actively want to support them. Just as importantly, it provides them with a space not defined by cancer. It provides children with a space to play, be curious, fail and possibly not think about what their parents may be going through. It allows them to experience all the joys of childhood. Equally important to me is that parents do not have to pay to send their children to camp. Giving both parents and children the economic freedom and peace of mind to enjoy camp without worrying about the cost is a true gift. ","Since my sophomore year of high school, I experienced a form of bipolar disorder undiagnosed and often unseen by even the people closest around me. It was only in October of this year, when I reached out to get help and began the process of therapy that I have started to improve dramatically. For years, I was too ashamed to reach out and get help and consequentially suffered severe and debilitating mood swings. For a long time, I felt out of control and helpless. I often wonder if I would get rid of my experience with mental health challenges altogether if it were possible. While it has been the single most challenging experience for me, experiencing mental health issues has made me a more deeply empathetic person, a better person, and I believe a better counselor. It has made me deeply appreciate the people who have supported me, and given me an independence and resilience which have helped me in circumstances outside of mental health. It has made me empathize with those experiencing mental health issues and those who experience social stigma. It has given me the ability to extend a patience, an understanding and a warmth to those around me that I may not have had otherwise. ","https://imgur.com/a/nIHVSeJ

Dates: September 2018- Present
Description: As a member of Flying Treehouse, I help teach elementary school students creative writing, namely helping them to craft their own original stories that have elements such as detail, conflict, dialogue, and a moral. After our teaching period, we use the stories written by the students to create a show, which is eventually performed for them at their schools. ","Role: Counselor @ Camp Providence
Dates: July 2015- August 2015
Description: Counselor for Camp Providence, a summer camp designed to serve members of the special needs community and their families. Worked with two children between 8-9 years of age. ","One organization that I have devoted my time to extensively is the Village Theatre KIDSTAGE program, located in Everett, Washington. In my time spent at KIDSTAGE, I have acted in over 13 musicals and volunteered for a plethora of others. As a senior in high school, I had the opportunity to act as a mentor for several of the younger children, culminating in the opportunity to choreograph RENT: School Edition for the KIDSTAGE Summer Independent Project. Another meaningful group I have been a part of is Ram's Head Theatrical Society. As a cast member in Gaieties, I not only performed in the production, but I learned useful skills in marketing, construction, and time management, among others. Finally, my work in Flying Treehouse has been an extraordinarily memorable part in my Freshman fall quarter. Working with children has always been a passion of mine, especially in considering a career in education and teaching, so having the opportunity to foster a creative environment for youth has been an incredible impact in my life ",My favorite childhood memory is eating an entire Mile High Mud Pie at Red Robbin. By myself. That's it. It was glorious.,"1.) I can fold my tongue into weird shapes. I can also lick my elbow.

2.) I have a fantastic Toadette impression. I have a horrible British accent. Putting them together is a dangerous combination.

3.) On a more serious note, I understand how rough coping with cancer can be-- my grandfather died from stage IV prostate cancer. I have seen firsthand how impactful organizations like Camp Kesem can be, particularly for younger children who may not fully comprehend what is happening, or who may not have the emotional tools necessary to process this strenuous period. If I were to work at Camp Kesem, I would do everything and anything in my authority to ensure that each child has a memorable and fulfilling experience in their week at camp.","At Kasem, I would be really excited to teach fun songs and games to the campers! From my experience with Treehouse, I have a very large arsenal of educational tools that I would love to lead, including games such as Statues, 7 Things, and Metamorphic Circle. My absolute favorite game is Bus Stop, in which the objective of the game is to weird-out your partner so much that they leave the imaginary bus stop at which the game takes place. Overall, I think it would be an amazing experience to share the games that I grew up playing with campers.","I want to volunteer for Camp Kesem to explore my interests in the field of education, particularly in concerns to teaching, crafting activities, and creating meaningful mentor-student relationships. Furthermore, I want to dedicate my summer to service-oriented activities; at Kesem, not only would I be able to intertwine my passion as a prospective educator with my service-related goals, but I would also be able to understand and identify new perspectives that I would otherwise not be exposed to. To be frank, I have been extraordinarily privileged with the opportunities I have been given in my life. Nonetheless, I would love the opportunity to use this privilege as a tool for fostering positivity and encouragement in a difficult time.",,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpUXQIObQP0

Description: Volunteered at over 20 events throughout 2 years at various primary schools, community centers, and local social events.","Sizzle Szzzz. My dad was cooking dinner again. As a 2nd grader, I was usually focused on my Nintendo DS. However, today I was curious. Since my mom would always come home late from work, my dad would surprise her with a banquet every evening. I was impressed by how food could just magically appear.

With my head just above the counter, I asked him if I could help. My reasoning? “I love mommy as much as you do.” 

After placing me on a stool, my dad guided my hands towards the wok handle. Thinking I was satisfied, he smiled and wanted to take a photo. As he went to go fetch the camera, I remembered all the cooking shows we would watch on Sunday mornings. Confident, I tried to do exactly what one chef did. I tossed the contents of the wok in the air and did my best to catch the food. Unfortunately, I missed. By a lot. However, to my surprise, my dad wasn’t upset at all. He simply picked the food back up with chopsticks and continued to cook with me as his personal assistant. I was the occasional stirrer, seasoner, and taste tester. After every meal, it shocked me that making delicious food was so simple. Starting then, I helped my dad cook more and more, and eventually, I started cooking my own dishes independently. From that one childhood experience, I found one of my passions: cooking.","Since first grade, I have been consistently given the nickname BFG (Big Friendly Giant). Although I’m 6’4” and play center in basketball, I want people to know that inside I’m a very soft person who loves everyone and has cried several times during Coco.

Despite being bad at singing and the guitar, my favorite pastime is singing and playing the guitar.

I love cooking, specifically making Chinese dishes. I enjoy introducing people to my culture and reminding some Chinese people of cooking back home. ","At camp, I want to remind kids to be kind and most importantly, to share. In addition to sharing physical objects such as snacks or games, I want kids to be inclusive of each other. No one should have the feeling of being left out. Sharing is a vital life skill worth teaching because it makes everyone happier and encourages generosity.","During a volunteer shift at Texas Children’s Hospital, a nurse pulled me aside. She quickly explained the situation; her patient not only had no one to play with, but he was also very sick. Immediately, I put on gloves and a gown and brought the toy cart.

The nurse wasn’t exaggerating. As I walked into the patient’s room, long tubes and beeping sounds filled the room. Grabbing a handful of games, I offered him our most popular ones. “Monopoly? Candyland? How about Battleship?” To my surprise, he refused them all and simply went to the pile to pull out a card game called Skip-Bo. When I started reading the rulebook, he stopped me and said he wanted to teach me. I was completely astounded. He was an amazing teacher.

Although we played the game for several hours, it felt like time just flew by. As we played, he spoke about very disparate topics. However, all of our conversations would always lead to how he really wanted to go back home up North. Sadly, when I started my next volunteer shift, his room was empty.

I realized that children are young souls with pure hearts. In no circumstance should they have to face grievous situations. Camp Kesem offers me an opportunity to help kids who are dealing with tough situations and to keep them focused on the fun of childhood. As a counselor, I want to leave a lasting impact to help them become the best that they can be.","Not too long ago, my grandfather lost his battle with leukemia. What made it worse was that my family had just planned a trip to China to go visit him.

As a child, I was very close with my grandfather. He cared about me so much that he would devote countless hours making sure I was a happy and healthy boy. Whether that meant cooking me my favorite dishes or buying me toys from the local market, his caretaking was so impactful to me and helped shape who I am today. Losing him was difficult for all of us.

Having experienced a cancer-related death in my family, I want to help others who are overcoming similar grief. It’s painful, but offering support is always helpful.","(\__/)

My brother, aged around 12, pulls out a wrestling WWE belt from under his bed. My sister and I slowly begin to back up and my older sister manages to escape the room while my brother traps me inside. I, fearful for my life, anticipate his diabolical plans and immediately, and imaginatively of course, conjure up a fireball to throw at him. He dodges and instead wrestles me to the ground, claiming that he was the new ultimate WWE champion. I scream and my sister runs in to help, again throwing a water ball (because of course she was a water bender at the time) to aid in my resistance against my brother. We continue to fight and run around the house doing everything from through ourselves into the dryer and just tumbling inside them to trying to fit fitted sheets over us on the bed that we all shared. This is my favorite childhood memory because of the freedom I had, the freedom to simply enjoy with my siblings until my parents got back. The freedom that was immediately destroyed when my brother entered his first year of high school and for the first time locked his room against the open passage of me and my sister.

Dates: April-May 2016, 2017

Description: I worked collaboratively with a group of selected students to perform a play meant to raise awareness about and denounce intolerance of any and every kind, ethnic prejudice, and bigotry. I contributed by performing a monologue about what the hardships of an immigrant, especially as a teenager leaving behind her home. This activity gave me the opportunity to work to raise awareness and denounce intolerance.","“Hello, Dolly! Well, hello Dolly... it’s so nice to have you back where you belong…” Abuelo Sammy, my grandfather, and I sang musicals, parading around his picture-covered home in Montevideo, Uruguay, the smell of chicken noodle soup lingering in the air. When I visited every summer he would scoop me up and twirl me around, blasting Barbra Streisand. Abuelo exposed me to the pure joy of musicals. As I grew older, he taught me to dig into the plot, and keenly observe how characters followed their intentions, while they toiled to become who they aspired to be.","I produced/conceived an artistic project (Love is the Answer) in which I involved teenagers from arts camp to collaborate to raise funds for Hancock-French Woods Arts Alliance, which gives underprivileged kids scholarships to study the arts in college.

I LOVE Brazilian samba music!!! I listen to it to and from class. Something about Vinicius (a Brazilian poet and lyricist) makes me so happy :)

Sometimes, life feels nonstop. I love to meditate, especially outdoors. I find that I am happiest when I take a second to inhale, exhale, and appreciate my surroundings. ","I am a huge fan of the arts. I think that there is something healing in music. I have been doing musical theater my whole life, and I have been involved in over 25 productions. I would love to help out in any way I can, especially through teaching kids songs, dance, and acting. I would love to help organize a performance by the kids! 
","When my middle school drama teacher, David Nardone, was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer in August of 2016, I was devastated. A good friend of mine called me and asked me to help her and be on the board of organizers with her idea of a benefit concert for Mr. Nardone, to help him fight the fight. I immediately accepted and took action. I was able to recruit people to perform for the night, as well as performed myself, helped put together a video montague, collected pictures and reached out to people for donations and spread the word throughout the community. He was not feeling well enough to attend the night, but we put it on Facebook live stream and he was commenting and able to watch and enjoy. 
All though he is no longer with us, his spirit remains in the lives of so many of the kids whose lives he impacted. He is one of the people that has had the largest impact in my life; he inspired me to follow my dreams and pursue a career in the arts, while helping others. I want to help kids through the arts and inspire them to follow their dreams, just as Mr. Nardone did for me. 
","I am a mutt. I am Hispanic, Miami born with deep Eastern European roots. My great-grandparents immigrated to Uruguay and Argentina from Russia and Poland. The next generations, born in South America, and became the new locals, singing Spanish songs while holding on to Jewish melodies. 
What does being Hispanic mean to me? Community. Support. Acceptance. Passion. Music. Food. Not necessarily in that order. We eat, kiss, hug a lot, are rather loud, dance and sing. My parents came to build new lives. My mom's first job was cleaning shelves at a shoe store. She took public transportation, 2.5 hours each way, in order to audit post-graduate classes at the University of Miami. My dad worked as a counselor for South American teenagers. Working hard, smiling, loving & eating well, I was taught this country was generous to them.
As a born American whose mother tongue is Spanish, I honor my past. I share my beliefs to empower my generation of Latinos by staying involved. In Spanish Honor Society, I taught Spanish to young kids, and am more than willing to teach Spanish to kids at Kesem. 
One of the gifts I’m given as a daughter of immigrants is being able to see myself and others through different perspectives. I see mutts all around me, even those whose families have been here for generations. We're proud, tough and strong. We strive to belong and to contribute in a positive way to our communities. Maybe we aren't that different after all.

","Growing up, I really wanted to be an actress. Despite not having the stage presence needed to shine as a thespian, I created a powerpoint presentation to convince my parents to let me move to Los Angeles. Shockingly, my parents refused despite my very respectable attempt to figure out Microsoft Powerpoint at ten years old. They instead let me go to Los Angeles for one audition to gather more information about the life of a child star. I sent out my headshots for a few months and ultimately got a response from Zoey 101’s casting agents. Elated, I decided to put my best foot forward and dressed in army cargo pants & a cropped sequin top to make sure they knew I could play any role ranging from soldier to disco queen. I arrived at the casting agent’s office, sure that I was on the cusp of my big break. Although I have struggled with making decisions throughout my life, I look back on this audition as an uncomplicated and irrefutable moment of clarity. I left knowing that I didn’t want to be an actress. I look back on this memory with confusion and wonder: how did I find such overwhelming certainty?  
","My freshman year of high school, I got a call from my school asking if I would be willing to move for a year to Tokyo, Japan through an exchange program with our sister school. 
I didn’t… 100%... know where Japan was on the map and didn’t speak any Japanese, but I instantly said yes, sure that an ask so unexpected was worth paying attention to. This moment and the learnings of the year that followed have been the foundation upon which I’ve built my life. My immediate excitement about a future I had never considered reinforced that I want to be a “yes and” person. Another big insight was through living and learning with Japanese students who did not speak English. Because I didn't know any Japanese, I fumbled through almost every conversation I had. Through these wildly imcoherent conversations, I was able to build stronger connections than I ever had before. This experience instilled in me the belief that deep emotional connection comes through vulnerability. Finally, the transitory nature of the program was my first experience in needing to “be here now.” If I had emotionally protected myself from others for fear of leaving Japan and likely never returning, I would not have developed as strong of relationships. In turn, I learned that the antidote to worrying about change is being radically present. I often forget that, and especially have throughout senior year, but my year in Japan instilled a desire to practice this value. 
","An activity I loved leading with my kids at Sierra Camp was an acts of kindness bingo board. We created boards that featured different & often underappreciated “superheroes” around camp. We then empowered our campers to perform an act of kindness for each of the people on their bingo board. We then gave treasure to the children who completed bingo, reminding them that they have the power to be superheroes for others every day. This activity could be easily transferred to older age groups, and I would love to facilitate this experience for Kesem campers!! 
","The values of Camp Kesem and the responsibilities of a Camp Kesem counselor directly align with the work I want to do professionally and the kind of person I want to be. My two greatest passions have always been supporting children and providing emotional support. Camps have been the place in which I have been most able to do both. I have been a camp counselor for a month or longer every summer since the July before my senior year of high school. I have worked with children a lot outside of camp settings, and there is a unique quality to a child opening up, finding themselves, and finding each other in the context of a summer camp. I have never supported a child whose life has been so intimately touched by cancer but have become passionate about this topic through my work with Stanford Dance Marathon’s beneficiary, the Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital for childhood cancer and blood diseases. I plan to go to school for social work after graduating with the hope of receiving a masters to work with kids who have experienced trauma and loss. Camp Kesem would provide the opportunity to grow both professionally and personally as I prepare for a life of work with kids who have similar stories to Kesem campers. 
","My dad started participating in Lakota Native American ceremonies when he was twenty-eight. His Alcoholics Anonymous sponsor, Mary Thunder, introduced him to the director of the American Indian Movement. This man, named Chief Leonard Crow Dog, allowed my father to be the first white spiritual intercessor of a tribally authorized, non-reservation, Lakota Native American Sundance. The Sundance is the most honored of all Lakota ceremonies; a four-day journey through each participant’s heart demanding complete surrender to tunkashila, the Great Spirit. 
        	Given my unique position as a white participant in a tribally authorized Lakota Native American ceremony, I grew up thinking a lot about cultural appropriation, whiteness, and privilege. The differences in opportunities between those who participated in my father’s multiracial ceremonies off the reservation and the Lakota Native American people who participated in ceremonies on the Rosebud Reservation were vast, and I was unsure where that left me as a white, upper-middle class girl with a white, upper middle class father who was tribally authorized by the leader of the American Indian Movement to run ceremonies that he credits as the sole reason he got sober. 
Fourteen years later, and I still don’t know. My questions have only multiplied and become more complicated. And yet, I always carry this story with me as I walk through the world and try to make sense of the experiences that have brought me here - to today.

Dates: Summers of 2017 and 2018, 60+ hrs/wk
Role: Through managing phone calls, negotiating reservations, handling 280+ cover nights and navigating the busy restaurant life, I developed a strong work ethic and dedication to smooth operation and taking things in stride","One by one, the cousins gather on the tiny house's porch that hangs over the beach, writhing with anticipation. The tide has been slowly creeping in, and now it laps the stilts of the house. When the water is high enough, the cousins gleefully leap of the porch into the open sea as the grandparents smile from rickety rocking chairs. Finding myself a part of this family feels like love. Occasionally I will dive into the waves until the deep coolness shrouds me and allow myself a shriek of pure contentment. The waves are endless in one direction, the sand dunes in another; the line of tiny houses the barrier between. I am four, then twelve; sixteen, and nine. The years are interchangeable because stepping onto the beach where my father was raised feels timeless. It is the one place I can leave the world behind and simply be--it is beautiful, and kind, and sacred.","1) I am from a tiny island called Nantucket, 30 miles off the coast of Massachusetts. You won't find traffic lights, highways, or chain stores there. Instead, you'll find the incredible, tight-knit community that shaped me. Coming from an island has allowed me to cultivate a deep appreciation of what it means to truly belong somewhere, and this is something I seek to recreate in every relationship, connection, or otherwise meaningful activity I pursue. Living on Nantucket taught me that a sense of belonging can create a safe space in an otherwise terrifying world.

2) The nicest thing anyone has every done for me was when my APUSH teacher from high school took me out to breakfast the morning before I came to Stanford and presented me with a card with $100 in it an strict instructions to spend this on myself and not funding my education. I'm not sure he knew what a tough spot I was in financially, but his selflessness and inherent kindness meant the world to me more than any amount of money. If I can be for just one person what that teacher was, and is, for me, I will have lived the life I hoped I would.

3) <-- This is my favorite number. I have no idea why.","Reading, and the exploration of stories, played an incredibly influential role on my development as a person. Identifying with characters in books was something so crucial to providing my guidance when I felt lost or unaccepted that I am only truly beginning to realize its impact now. To that end, I would be thrilled to lead a workshop engaging campers in an appreciation of storytelling -- whether through exploring podcasts, plays, books, movies -- anything to open the door to endless worlds that reading provided for me and to which I attribute my sound mental health to this day.","Many of the activities I have engaged in over the years, at first by circumstance, involve working with children -- babysitting my neighbor's twins, volunteering to tutor elementary school students after school, working at the very children's library I was practically raised in -- but it is only in hindsight I realize what a profound impact every instance in which I was working with kids has had on me. I continued to babysit my neighbors for the next six years and developed such an enduring connection that they have come to feel like a second family; a month into my job at the library, I found myself stuffing my pockets with spare change before leaving for work to pay for kids' fines because I so identified with the young child reading in a corner, lost in a world that is not their own. 
I was not a very happy child: I was bullied severely for a large part of my childhood, and I face some difficulties at home, but I will always remember the few people who stood up for me or simply stood by me during the worst of times. It is perhaps selfishly, then, that I want nothing more than to be this person for someone in a situation similar to what mine once was, in a way that would pay tribute to those who did the same for me but also open my eyes to entirely new perspectives and develop relationships I'll treasure for years to come. ",,"A story:

A girl is frantically preparing for her Stanford interview, which had to be transferred to a Skype call last-minute because she was supposed to meet her interviewer on the mainland but there was a storm so all the boats were cancelled. Her interviewer, Marvin (Stanford '60 (!!!)) is struggling to use Skype and keeps calling her to let her know that he is ""headed over to his friend Mark's house who is good at the computer"". The interview: things are going well, suspiciously well. In a moment that would not be this good if it were scripted, the girl glances  down at this very moment and realizes with a shudder that she is wearing a Georgetown shirt.
The end (spoiler: girl = me)

Dates: Summer 2018
I volunteered for 8 weeks at the AGN School in Tamil Nadu, India. There, I designed and taught interdisciplinary science curricula and formed deep friendships with the students, teachers, and staff at the school. Because their textbooks were outdated and emphasized memorization of basic content over problem-solving in the real world, I wrote up three additional chapters for their high school biology curriculum. I also created interdisciplinary lesson plans for middle and high school classes that spanned astronomy, photography, dolphin physiology, and math. Now I am the co-chair of applications for Project Dosti and will help run spring workshops for this year’s volunteers. 

2) USA Biology Olympiad
Dates: 2016 - ongoing 
Description: I started participating in the USABO as a competitor, attending the National Finals twice in high school and competing on Team USA at the International Biology Olympiad in 2017. The competition was heavily male-dominated—only three out of the twenty Finalists were female in both years I attended camp, and I was the only girl on the team. I therefore became well-known within the community as the token female representative (and resident plant nerd). I continue to support the program by working as a TA during camp and volunteering as a question writer throughout the year. I also ran a fundraiser in September and individually raised 2,000 dollars for this program.

3) Department of Energy National Science Bowl
Dates: 2014 - ongoing
I competed nationally throughout high school as the first female captain of our school’s A team. I poured an immense amount of love, energy, and frustration into this team, and I left having completely changed the tryouts process, doubled female participation, and started an ongoing national championship streak. It’s kind of funny because it’s just a high school science competition, but people took it seriously and I became weirdly famous within the national community—coaches would shake my hand after matches, and middle school girls would come up to me and tell me I’d inspired them to pursue science. I’m now an alumni volunteer at the Bay Area regional and the national competition in D.C., where I help organize the competition, moderate for matches, design T-shirts, and best of all, hang out with the competitors. Bowl is love, bowl is life <3
","My best friend and I used to pretend we were cats from the Warriors book series and run around in the woods behind my house catching imaginary mice and fighting off imaginary invaders. One particularly snowy winter, we built a huge “den” out of snow and it was actually the most badass thing ever and didn’t completely melt until April because we’d made sure to freeze it solid. 
","1. I am willing to drop everything to help the people I care for. Sometimes this becomes stressful. 

2. I toe the line between extroverted and introverted, but I tend to be very open and energetic among younger kids. 

3. I am fortunate to have little to no experience dealing with the illness or death of a loved one, so I’m nervous that my understanding and empathy will not go deep enough (even though the website says it’s fine). However, I am a patient listener and have only ever given love unconditionally; I am confident in my ability to provide support in both loud and quiet ways. 
","I love to paint (and do arts/crafts in general), so I think it would really fun to run a painting activity with a creative twist! For example, we could have kids pair up and create goofy portraits of each other, or have a tag-team painting competition where each member of a team has two minutes to contribute to the canvas.","Grappling with concepts of illness and death has always intimidated me into silence; when I first heard about Kesem, I couldn’t imagine how a blissful lakeside summer camp could address the deep, inconceivable pain of children whose parents are affected by cancer. But after learning more about Kesem and speaking with counselors, I think I get it. Kesem defies the isolation and premature growing-up of these kids in the most direct way possible, and I want to contribute to this defying of disease. My career goals and research interests center around patients and their cells, but I also want to pour myself into supporting those affected by the illness of loved ones. I have worked extensively with children in the past, and I think Kesem provides a crucial support system for this particularly vulnerable age group. I want to be there always and unconditionally for these kids in any way I can, and Kesem is the most meaningful and magical way I’ve come across to do this. Additionally, I think Kesem will instill a tremendous amount of personal growth and wisdom. I have never experienced the loss or critical illness of a loved one up close and my family seldom discusses emotion, so I think I have a lot to learn from the emotional resilience and openness at Kesem. I know I will be incredibly inspired by both the campers and fellow counselors, and I hope to join and contribute to this community. 
","I come from a Chinese immigrant family and grew up never knowing when to switch between English and Mandarin. I came to Stanford from Boston, having discovered my passion in biology and medicine in the myriad institutions at my fingertips back home. I’m interested in the intersection of art and science and am pursuing degrees in both. I’ve traveled around the world for competitions and programs, I practically raised my little brother because my parents were never home, and I love to teach. I’ve devoted so much of myself to education—from private tutoring to teaching in classrooms across the world to designing curricula—and in the past I struggled with and overcame some very dark periods of my life. Because of all this, I’ve become very good with kids from diverse backgrounds and am confident in my ability to adapt to stressful, demanding, and novel situations. I’ve learned to communicate effectively and reach out for help, and my skills in both art and science lend themselves to random fun facts and activities for days.

I have two younger sisters in this age group, and I worked at a summer program at MIT this past summer with 15/16-year-olds so I'm comfortable with the age group.

I also loved my experience working at MIT this summer because I attended the same program when I was in high school which completely changed my view of higher education and allowed me to build a new community of amazing individuals at schools across the nation. I also love the outdoor house community here on campus through which I have been able to partake in many awesome adventures and make great friends!,"When I was a child I lived in a relatively rural area. On my whole street, there were only 2 other kids the same age as me so we would spend a lot of time together, usually outside. My favorite memory is that one year one of my friends on my street was throwing a Halloween party, and for the first time at the ripe age of 6 my mother gave me permission to walk over alone. It seems silly, and at that moment I was just excited to run as fast as I could to get to the candy. Looking back now, however, I realize how fortunate I was to live in such an amazing community where I was safe and comfortable. That sense of comfort and excitement that I had running .5 miles to my neighbor's house in a pink dress is something that I have since sought to recreate. I hope that any sort of permanent community that I am able to join can offer me a similar feeling and that in my participation I am able to contribute to it.",,I would love to teach kids how to make ,I want to volunteer at ,,, (https://hillelatstanford.wufoo.com/cabinet/enlrZWg3azE3amFrMmk=/g0lqbPOcNb0%3D/),,, (https://hillelatstanford.wufoo.com/cabinet/enlrZWg3azE3amFrMmk=/g0lqbPOcNb0%3D/),,,12/4/18 15:22,public,12/4/18 15:37,public,128.12.254.132,5,0

","Since I was born, my parents have been really enthusiastic about history. This means that as a child, my family and I went on countless road trips to battlefields, cemeteries, and museums. I won’t lie, I used to dread these trips and beg for a trip to Disney or something else that I would deem fun. For spring break when I was in third grade, my family went to Boston. I was expecting to be nose-deep in Nancy Drew and bored out of my mind given my pre-existing (and unenthused) knowledge of Paul Revere. On the first day, my family decided to start with the Freedom Trail. Yes, I rolled my eyes at first but as soon as I saw that we got to follow a thick red line through the streets of Boston, I got really excited. I quickly appointed myself as tour guide, and spent the day pretending to know what I was talking about as I herded my family through the sites. As the youngest in the family I had always felt 2 steps behind my brother and parents in terms of my knowledge base, but was enamored and energized with all of the potential to learn in a way that was digestible to me at a young age. To this day, I have a huge love of maps and take it upon myself to make trip itineraries for friends and family alike. 
","Upon first meeting me, a lot of people see me as a very loud and outgoing person. I love leading large groups and being someone to hype others up. On the other hand, I am also a reflective and quiet person who appreciates time to myself as well as supporting people in deeper one-on-one conversations. While the two strengths aren’t mutually exclusive, I think it can be easy to see my “hype” side, but I value my reflective side just as much. 

For most of high school, I worked at a local toy store called Big Smile Toys. I loved my job. Beyond becoming a skilled gift wrapper, I gained a wide knowledge on the best toys for certain age groups. I am an expert at helping a kid find exactly what they were looking for (within the price limits and desires of the guardian of course). 

During winter quarter last year, I was very much so feeling the sophomore slump. It was supposed to be a regular weekend, but with 3 friends I decided to drive to Disneyland and back in 22 hours. We left at 2 AM, passed through the hills of LA with the sun rising (and blasting Waving through a Window from Dear Evan Hansen) at 6 AM, went incredibly hard in the park from opening to 6 PM, and made it home by midnight. The joy and spontaneity from that adventure is something I am trying to find as often as possible in my life.
","I would love to facilitate learning on the value of active listening. I always struggled with how to show my support and care for people around me. I felt like I always needed to have answers  to fix things. Since staffing at the Bridge, I have learned to appreciate the value of listening. It sounds like something so simple, but it is so overlooked and something I wish I had learned much sooner in life. I want to allow time for children to practice active listening skills and feel their power. It's a skill that is useful for a lifetime. 
","Courage. Each year of my life the meaning of this word continues to change. I used to think courage was simply standing up to your fears in a physical way, whether it was jumping off of the deep end or trying a new vegetable at dinner. As I grew up, courage started to shift into not being afraid of speaking up for myself and what I needed. This lesson was hard for me to learn, but something so important to feeling comfortable and content with myself.
	I want to be part of Camp Kesem to help support kids in their journeys to becoming courageous. This could mean embracing their identity as a child and having the fun and laughter they deserve, or thinking about the range of emotions they’ve experienced and processing through that. I want to be able to contribute to the space that makes them comfortable enough to be the authentic version of themselves they need now. I have spent a considerable amount of time working with children in different settings, and get so much joy out of seeing them learning and growing. This is especially true when I find myself learning from them just as much as they’re learning from each other. I greatly admire how volunteers are able to see the campers as humans more so than statistics. I would be incredibly grateful to play just a small part in their journeys. 
","Growing up I was very lucky as my family was able to send me to a variety of camp experiences. Looking back on all of this now, I understand how I gained so much independence and courage from these experiences. But, I struggled a lot before and during these camps for reasons I didn’t understand at the time. A few days before camp I always started feeling physically ill, and by the time the day to leave came I could barely think about what I was doing much less be able to appreciate the opportunity in front of me. I always spent the first few days feeling very out of place, very sad, very insecure, and very isolated. I passed it off as something that was incredibly normal, and it wasn’t until years later I started to see how this negatively and unnecessarily pulled me away from the present moment as a form of anxiety. 
Now, at 21 years old, I still don’t have answers and still find myself getting pulled into my own head in certain situations. But, it is easier for me to see how the world isn’t as terrifying as my mind sometimes tries to make it out to be. While some campers jump right in to the flow at Camp Kesem, I want to be there to provide comfort and encouragement to those who might struggle more with opening up and feeling confident in themselves.

In CISV, we spend a lot of time doing follow-along song and dance routines called energizers. At one of my camps, I got the superlative of the energizer bunny as everyone knows how much I love them. This is a video of me teaching the start of one of these energizers (its really like 6 minutes so it's the very start), during dead week in a frosh dorm lounge.

In particular there is one friend of hers who came from a difficult family background who I spent a lot of time with and provided a lot of support to.

I also helped plan programs to help minority students to get access to resources that could help bridge the achievement gap at my high school.","Starting when I was about two years old my family spent a week every August at a family camp in Maine. During family camp, every night my dad would play guitar and sing around a camp fire while we made s'mores with the other kids. The songs that my dad played then like Cat Steven's ""Wild World"" and ""Father and Son"" still mean so much to me and remind me of these memories and make me feel connected to my family and these times. I remember being so excited about being able to go from camp-fire to camp-fire as there were different ones in different clusters of cabins and as a five year old I felt incredibly free and loved the independence of being able to explore the camp on my own or with friends. Having a safe place to begin exploring both the natural surroundings and the feeling of being independent was incredibly important to me. My association of the above mentioned songs to this beginning exploration brings me back to a feeling of excitement and growth but also safety and comfort. ","When I was in eighth grade I was diagnosed with depression. I hadn't felt happy for a while but I was only able to admit it to myself in April of that year. In August the summer before I started high school I went to camp for two weeks in Maine - the same camp I had gone to for family camp as a little kid. Camp was the first place I told anybody about my depression and it played a huge role in putting me on a path to becoming more comfortable with vulnerability and with the idea that it was okay to be struggling. After camp I went home and was quite open about the issues I had been dealing with, and was able to see that make other people more comfortable who had also been struggling. This experience was incredibly important to me and changed my outlook, making me want to share if it could help other people as well. 

I'm very highly motivated and energetic. If I set my mind to something I pursue it with intense determination and like to try to find different ways to make it work even if there seem to be obstacles that would normally put a stop to things. 

I really value authenticity and integrity. I think this makes me have a much easier time empathizing than sympathizing. I like to understand context about situations and people and to be able to empathize with them. ","I like being active, so while I'm not great at any particular sport I would be excited about helping facilitate a sport or other active program. I also like being in the water and swimming, so anything water related would be great!","The challenges that I faced in my childhood that forced me to grow up faster than what might have been ideal are something that I am overall grateful for because they have given me the ability to have a greater degree of empathy and to be able to help other kids who have gone through difficult and traumatic situations even when those situations are very different. I would love the opportunity to be part of a network that supports these kids who are dealing with the stress and fear related to having a parent who has or has had cancer. Some of the relationships I believe I have learned the most from are mentorship relationships and I think that I would learn so much from being a counselor at Camp Kesem. I want to be a part of creating an environment where these kids feel comfortable and understood, and think that I would be able to contribute meaningfully to such an environment. ","I've grown up in a multi-cultural household with a mom from Ohio and a dad from Argentina. I've gotten to see Argentina as well as to understand the challenges facing developing nations, which has been really important to me especially in the past year. I grew up with two parents who worked full time while many of my friends had a parent who stayed at home, which forced me to become more independent at a young age, figuring out how to get to activities using public transportation or taxis, as well as learning how to take care of myself. Facing challenges with mental health in the end of middle school and beginning of high school was also super important in shaping who I am. ","The following is something I shared with the friend of my sisters for whom I have acted as a mentor. One of my favorite things to do is to share the media that is important to me and that has helped me.

The experience in Troop/Venture 8 of taking responsibility for the lives of middle schoolers, coupled with the challenge of learning technical outdoor skills, has dramatically changed who I am and how I act. I have learned whitewater kayaking and rescue skills, gone backcountry ski mountaineering, and spent long nights writing detailed trip schedules and meal plans for 30.
My responsibilities included teaching middle schoolers outdoor and personal skills, 8th-10th graders how to plan and lead, and helping organize and run more ambitious and technical outdoor trips with my peers.
As a Troop participant since middle school, my experience has come full circle. Today, I get to be the cool older guy who I looked up to and followed back then. I feel very proud that I am a part of this long chain of teaching and learning.
Aside from this experience, I'm a big believer in the power of outdoor education to change lives and make people grow. It was something that had a huge impact on my life, and to this day I feel incredibly fortunate that I was afforded that rare opportunity. I would truly appreciate the chance to continue giving something that was so valuable to me back to kids who've undergone incredibly traumatic experiences.","Role: Assistant Senior Patrol Leader in Troop 8 Outdoor Leadership Program

Description: One of the most meaningful experiences of my life was tutoring several kids as part of the Fortis Elementary after-school program last year. The sense that I was making a difference, however small, in a young kid’s life was powerful. Although this experience of tutoring was a small act with a small impact, it still meant a lot to me because of the relationships I got to develop with great kids.

Role: Co-leader, Students Organized Against Racism; Member, SLAP
Dates: 2015-2018; 2018
Description: In SOAR, we held and helped plan open discussion groups on racial issues, intended to promote dialogue within the school. Of the discussion groups that I led, the one that I thought was the most productive was centered around National Anthem protests. I felt like it was one of very few times in my life where I saw people from drastically different viewpoints have somewhat productive dialogue, something I’m still very proud of. I wanted to continue being involved in activist work this year, and so I joined SLAP and help organize a reading group around prison abolition.","One childhood memory (or really set of childhood memories) that sticks out to me was when I would visit my grandparents garlic and chicken farm in rural Illinois. There, they held an annual event for the local nature center called Garlic Fest. I’ll never forget the last garlic fest I went to, because there were so many memories wrapped up in that day. I remember my baby cousin, only one or two at the time, riding my grandparents dog like a horse. I remember exploring the surrounding creek while eating raw garlic and garlic popcorn, remember the chickens running wild (the last time I saw them alive before a fox ate all of them). More than anything else, though, I remember comprehending the incredible cultural breadth of my family for the first time, from the white Chicago cosmopolitans who made the trip down, to my father and his family who immigrated from East Africa after generations away from their Indian origin, to the white rural farmers and country-dwellers in my family who called this place home. I realized I was a part of a history beyond my full comprehension.
Then, since I was 10 and not used to deep thinking, I went back to watching my cousin ride the dog, ran around with a football, and ran around the nature preserve until we found a pond, which we named Lake Celia after my cousin. Every time I go back to the farm, that pond remains Celia’s Lake.
","First: I am, above all else, a goofy person, even (and especially) when it’s awkward to be one. Some defining moments of my high school career include when my spanish teacher would tell a (usually dumb) joke, and I would laugh uncontrollably for what was usually the remaining half-hour in class, derailing whatever lesson plan my poor teacher had. To make matters worse, my laugh sounds like I’m having an asthma attack. While my goofiness can be inconvenient, it defines who I am and how I interact with others.

Second: Because of this goofiness, I really enjoy working with kids. In many of ways, I’m still a kid at heart. Humor that only elementary schoolers are allowed to like is still very funny to me. In my free time, I still do kid stuff like invent new sports with friends. On top of this, I feel like I’m a pretty caring person, especially when it comes to recognizing emotional needs of kids in these contexts.

Third: I care deeply about being open to deviating from plans. Spontaneous experiences have taught me the most on my journey through life, especially in outdoor and instructional contexts. Many kids have had crazy experiences that influence both their knowledge and behavior, and as an instructor you have no way of knowing what those are until you’re in the thick of things. The ability to understand and draw from these experiences on the fly is crucial to a positive experience for everyone.
","I will say before I answer that I am very open to teaching or facilitating any number of activities as long as doing so is within my ability to do safely. That said, some of my favorite camp activities include music workshops, as well as outdoor development teaching sessions. I’d also love to teach canoeing and sailing.

Outside of traditional activities, I have some fun ideas. I was thinking about a life-size hungry-hungry-hippos tournament; basically, one participant lies on a skateboard with a plastic bin and helmet and someone else holds onto their legs and moves them back and forth.","As someone whose grandparents both had cancer, and had to watch multiple friends lose their parents to it, I’ve seen firsthand how tough this loss and burden is. One of my most vivid memories from when my friend lost his mother to cancer was when, the week after, some friends and I went over to his basement, played music and hung out for several hours. Over the course of that night, I saw my friend move from utterly despondent to enjoying the small things again. While I don’t want to make it sound like this is the result of some savior complex (because it’s not), I do think it’s important to note how impactful small distractions and fun things can be in these situations to helping make life just a little better at a really tough, vulnerable time. To be able to be part of this distraction for other kids would truly be an honor.

Beyond this, I’ve always had a deep appreciation of camp. As someone who helped run a summer camp for middle schoolers in my outdoor group back in high school, and as someone who attended that very summer camp as a middle schooler, I have a deep appreciation for the amount of personal growth that can take place in these environments. I would love to be able to provide this same opportunity for growth for kids at a particularly vulnerable time of their life.","Honestly, I’ve lived a pretty lucky life. I picked good parents to be born to. I’ve never been homeless, food insecure, or even anywhere close to either of those things. I’ve never had any significant health problems that really threatened my well-being. College was never an if or when but a where. 
That said, I would say that the defining experience of my childhood was the lack of a clear community, whether racial, ethnic, or religious. For most of my childhood, I was always sort of White, sort of Indian, sort of African, sort of Jewish, sort of Christian, sort of Muslim. It was a complete mess of an identity. As my friends had Upanayana and Bar Mitzvahs, I ate beef samosas as a Yom Kippur observance.
	Eventually, this sense of not fitting in, of being not just different but markedly different, became my identity. I stopped trying to force my way into communities where I clearly didn’t fit. I was no longer the oddball within a group, but instead the leader of my own. I had very little cultural baggage. I got to develop my own identity, my own belief system, my own way of weighing moral problems. The mental challenge of reconciling all of these things for myself, rather than having them handed to me in a package marked with background, was a blessing. The need to figure out my own cultural context led me to become far more aware of the society that surrounded me.

For my little brother's fifth birthday, we made a cake in the shape of a 5 covered with dump trucks, bulldozers, and Oreo dirt. For my sister's sixteenth, we made her a prison cake saying ""16 years hard time"" to celebrate her impending freedom (driver's license). One year, we moved into a new house that had an old tree in the backyard that needed to be cut down. Instead of hiring someone who knows something about trees like a rational person, my dad decided to learn how to cut it down himself. He spent months watching video tutorials, ordering supplies, and planning. He did succeed, and that year we made him a tree cake with mini tools made of fondant. After I had a bone marrow transplant to treat my leukemia when I was 19, they made a T cell cake for my 20th birthday to celebrate my new bone marrow/T cells. The cakes are not always beautiful (okay they almost never are) but they are so personal and filled with love. Every year we are excited to see what everyone comes up with. ","1) I am the second of 4 siblings and we are all really close. We grew up in the suburbs of Sacramento, which is totally underrated. It was very outdoorsy and we spend a lot of time hiking, going to the lake, skiing, etc.

2) I was a freshman in 2013-14 (I know, I'm old) but had to take 2 medical leaves of absence for cancer treatment. I am now hoping to graduate in 2019, which I think is not too shabby given everything that has happened. 

3) I am a humbio major and do research at the Stanford Cancer Center! I was already a humbio major before I was diagnosed (I get that question a lot). ","I would love to host a creative writing group. Even really young kids have the ability to get their words out! I have done a few creative writing circles to help me deal with my own cancer diagnosis and they are incredibly cathartic - we don't even have to address cancer specifically. A prompt like ""The fire was lit"" can spur imagination about burning rage or a cozy camp fire. ","When I was diagnosed with leukemia at age 19, I felt incredibly alone. I had and still have the best friends in the world - they visited me constantly, checked in on me daily, came for milestone events like shaving my head of my bone marrow transplant day. But, no matter how hard they tried they could never fully understand what I was going through. I spent 8 months inpatient due to the intensity of my treatment, and the community we formed on the bone marrow transplant unit could not be found anywhere else. The support of others who know what you are going through cannot be replicated. When something horrible happens, like a parent getting cancer, we can't take that pain away. But we can share it together and remind these kids that they are not alone and never will be. Being able to relate to peers is a benefit that even siblings and parents cannot completely fill, and it is incredibly important to me to give back and continue creating these spaces for people who need them. I also think that since I have had such a personal experience with cancer, including seeing my three siblings deal with the impact of my cancer on our family, I bring a level of empathy and understanding that would be impossible to develop most other ways. ","On June 18, 2015, just after my sophomore year at Stanford, I was diagnosed with high-risk acute myeloid leukemia. After my first round of chemo, I found out that I had not responded to treatment and was unlikely to survive. This set off a cascade of aggressive, experimental treatments that miraculously got me into remission so that I was able to get a bone marrow transplant on September 24, 2015. Having cancer has been an incredibly isolating experience for me, but also for my entire family. My younger siblings, who were still in high school, had little parental guidance since my parents were so busy with me in the hospital. My older sister got married and I missed the wedding. They worried I would die and they had to see me suffer. But as awful as all of this has been, the one thing that has consistently pulled us through is community - community with other families on the oncology floor at Children's Hospital Oakland, where I was treated, community within our hometown and extended family, community within our schools. In a really awful situation like cancer, when you can't solve it the best thing you can do is go through it together. I bring that perspective - both of someone who has struggled/is struggling with cancer and of someone who has seen the joy that community can bring even in the hardest of times.

157,Tyler,Shibata,4/22/00,18,Male,Chemistry,Freshman,4247310446,yoyo2000@stanford.edu,ryotyler@hotmail.com,"Cedro, Wilbur",313,2,7,5,4,3,6,1,"Before starting my freshman year, I had one of the most memorable weeks of my life going on SPOT, being able to spend a week without external stimulants and base camping in Mt. Lassen. Not only did I have the opportunity to spend a week with completely new people in a completely new environment, but I was able to take my time and reflect on my life in this environment without external pressures. Listening to the stories of other campers and telling my own, I realized that most of us never really take time to reflect on our lives and appreciate the things we cherish. I credit SPOT for allowing me to enter my freshman year with a healthy mindset, and I would love to provide such an opportunity for high school sophomores and juniors, which more often than not is the demographic that least takes time out of their day to reflect on their lives.","During the summer of 2017, I was an intern at the pediatric center of Martin Luther King Jr. Community Hospital. Located in Compton at the border line between Blood and Crip territory, children with unstable households would come in frequently to be referred to protective care services. As the doctors and nurses were busy dealing with administrative tasks, I often enjoyed talking to these children about their favorite hobbies and TV shows, most of which we shared. Though it was a brief period of time, it was the most fulfilling period of my life as I went to the hospital every day knowing that I would be able to have a lasting, positive impact on someone's life just by having a conversation with them.

I also have a younger sister, who is simply a baller. You can usually catch us tearing it up on Dance Dance Revolution or pulling pranks on our mother. Though she is 5 years younger, I seem to learn something new from her everyday. I am confident that if I am able to befriend someone as cool as she is, then I can befriend anyone.

","Over the summer of 2016, I was a teacher's assistant at the summer camp hosted by Experium Science Academy, where they would teach and demonstrate science experiments to children in grades K-8. I would often aide the teacher in facilitating interactions between the children, and playing with them during recess hours. I would usually find myself trading my old pokemon cards with them (I found out later I was ripped-off quite badly) or playing handball with them (there was definitely a height advantage for them). But my favorite thing to do at the camp was to help the kids with their science projects, and see their faces light up when they finally understand a concept. They'd jump up and down, and I'd jump up and down with them -- then, they would go straight back into working on their projects some more. I always admired these children who exhibit so much excitement for the things they do -- and from them I was able to learn that if you are excited with something, then it won't feel like work. Thus, even though I was a teacher at the camp, I learned just as much if not more from these kids at camp.","During middle school I had a huge crush on a girl who played the saxophone. Naturally, as an ignorant pre-pubescent boy, I decided to pick up the saxophone and join the marching band in an effort to get to know her. A very long story short, she rejected me. However, I was able to find a new love altogether, becoming a section leader and being able to teach the younger marchers the techniques necessary.

This past summer I had the honor of being a waiter at the fanciest restaurant in my hometown. While the pay was amazing, I often dealt with people of privilege giving me unreasonable demands -- interestingly, it was the most privileged who were the least generous in their tips. Nonetheless, I patiently greeted every customer with a smile, for I knew that bringing customers delicious plates of food can easily make someone’s day.

After 3 years of failed attempts, I finally made it onto my school’s speech and debate team my senior year. Public speaking is my greatest fear -- I have once peed my pants in second grade while I gave a presentation. Being on the team served as a constant reminder of my greatest fear, yet conversely a testament to my greatest strength. I have wet myself numerous times out of disgrace. But every time I wet myself, I climb back up on stage, with a fresh pair of underwear. 

One taught me love. One taught me patience. And one taught me pain.

Now I'm so amazing.
","Humming the chorus of “Thrift Shop”, I navigate the aisles of the Salvation Army store on a Saturday morning. Wearing a newly discovered pair of aviator sunglasses and a camouflage jacket, I am unstoppable; customers diverge from my path as I tread across fallen hangers, jackets, and toys. Broken Nerf gun at hand, I am on a mission. For the past decade, I have marched into this store every Saturday, inspecting every corner of the store for a hidden gem. A veteran of the terrain, I deftly maneuver my way to the back of the store, where uncharted territory lies--the untouched racks. After analyzing the pattern of the racks, I identify where the most recent batch of clothes are kept and pinpoint a peculiar suit which piques my interest. As I approach the location to secure my target, a sense of euphoria engulfs me as I recognize the unmistakable quality of a designer suit--eureka! Mission complete. I take my sunglasses off, basking in the glory of my conquest. 

On this fateful day I bought my favorite possession -- my $400 suit which I bought for $15. With my trusty super suit, I have blinged out at speech and debate tournaments, homecoming, prom, and everything in between. In my closet wherever I go, it serves as a reminder that the precious things in life aren’t things you buy with money, but with time. Stained with blood, sweat, and tears, my suit is the freshest piece of clothing I own.


","I think my most redeeming quality is my ability to cook a perfect steak. Every Thanksgiving, I am tasked with making dinner for my family -- choking on the abomination I cook every year, we always end the meal by being thankful that most things in the world are better than my cooking. We finish this ritual by finally digging in to the one thing I can actually cook -- the steak. Perhaps it’s the poorly cooked food that preceded it, but that steak is always the best thing I eat every year. If it means I can be with these kids for the summer, I am willing to give up this trade secret at my interview.

I am comically bad at singing, but I will sing anyways. I was once on a date with a girl and I attempted to hit the high note of ""Take On Me"". She broke up with me the next day. But terrible singing is inherently hype in a group setting. 
	
Also, sometimes before I sleep, I like to roll up in a bunch of blankets and pretend I’m a burrito. It’s really comfortable but sometimes I get stuck inside so I might need you to roll me back out (counterclockwise). I get stuck in a lot of things--waterslides (long story), regular slides, and various other slides (I hope there aren't any slides at camp) . I’ll need you to help me out when I do, but I’ll do the same for you. 
","My sister can hit the cleanest dab. Being 5 years younger then me, she is still on the cusp of puberty -- she has yet to feel the social pressures that would condemn such immaturity. Thus, she dabs, unashamed. Children tend to be the best dancers -- they truly commit themselves to the craft, in the name of pure fun. Given the opportunity, I would choreograph a dance with my campers, where each camper would come up with a dance move so we could mash them together into a performance we can present to the rest of camp.


","Kids would yelp out in laughter, as counselors would chase after the mischievous campers for yet another prank they pulled. A rather common sight on a warm summer day.

I would often stare out my window looking at events like these unfold, envious of the kids in my neighborhood park. With a sigh, I return to playing board games with my sister yet again. Another summer staying indoors, taking care of my sister instead.

With a single mother who couldn't afford to put both of her children in summer camps while she worked 2 jobs, summers were often riddled with chores, errands, and board games for me and my sister. Though I will always cherish the times I spent with my sister, I couldn't help but agonize over my situation -- summers were the source of most tension in our family, as I would beg my mother to let my sister and I go out on our own to the park and interact with the kids there. Worried about our safety, she would forbid us from doing so. Thus, for the first half of my life, I wasted my days in envy.

No child should have to look back at their summer in regret, simply because of familial circumstances. I would love to volunteer my time to Camp Kesem because I know that I would have the an enormously fulfilling experience knowing that I am actively participating in making someone's summer the best it can be. ","Growing up, I never had time to think about the luxuries other kids thought about. The newest video games, the nicest clothes -- these things waned in comparison to the pressing issue of whether our food stamps would cover food for that day. My father would always find a way out of child support payments, forcing my mother to work multiple jobs to support me and my sister. However, looking back I realize that what many think as a socioeconomic burden might have been a blessing. Because with scarcity, I was able to invest the little things I have into the things that matter most, perhaps out of necessity. These material luxuries we care about all fade eventually -- I chose to invest instead in my education, relationships, and well-being. Looking back, I see the friends that I have made, the talents I have honed, the joys I have experienced. And I realize that I did it all through what I was given--nothing more, and most importantly, nothing less. Thus, I can say with the utmost confidence that I have lived an incredibly rich life.","In my senior year, I participated in my school's pep rally to dance in tights in front of my whole school.

Dates: Freshman to Senior Year
Description: Elected co-president of this women’s empowerment organization senior year. Helped to instill a sense of identity and confidence in high school girls through weekly mentor meetings and through bigger group meetings with guest speakers who were powerful women. Organized volunteers to help UAHT (United Against Human Trafficking) during the Super Bowl.

Group: Student Government
Dates: Junior and Senior Year
Description:I was elected Fall rep Junior year and then Prefect Senior Year. I worked with our school’s student council in bettering the lives of both students and faculty. Planned homecoming and organized a fun day for the seniors to have one last school-sponsored hoorah before graduation.","When I was little (about kindergarten to second grade) I would always get in the bath after dinner, right before bed. My dad would come in, having been at work all day, and he would read me stories. Two stories in particular: The Giving Tree by Shel Silverstein and Tree in the Trail by Holling C. Holling. Now I don’t think there was a particular reason he read me these books about trees, but I always remember that time being my favorite part of my day. He worked so hard all day and then when he got home, rather than go sit on the couch and relax, he would spend every moment with my sisters and me. 
After I got into my pj’s, he would brush my teeth and then he and my mom would swing me into bed. I will never forget the intentional time both he and my mom put into their relationships with my sisters and me.
","1. I am sympathetic to others’ struggles and always seek to listen well and really understand and hopefully help either their situation or their mindset.
2. I went to camp for two weeks every summer from 6 years old to 17 years old and it was the absolute best part of my year. If I get the privilege to be a counselor at Camp Kesem I will strive to make it the best part of these kids’ summers.
3. I strive to make the best out of every situation and try really hard to be optimistic, even in the toughest times.
","I would be so excited to teach some sort of dance class at camp. I helped to lead a dance class with a couple other students when I was working in Bolivia and we made up the dances beforehand and then helped the class learn them and we had the most fun time. In my hard times also, I have found that dancing is such a nice way to just forget all the things weighing you down, to let loose, and just have such a carefree, fun time. I’d love to facilitate a happy environment as such at camp.","I want to volunteer my time to Camp Kesem because I feel as though I would have a lot to offer these kids in terms of advice or just be an understanding and sympathetic listener. I very much understand the toll having a sick parent takes on an individual. Because of my situation (see below) I feel as though I can help these kids have a clear and happy mind while at camp because I know just how straining illness can be, especially on the children of a sick parent.
","At age 23, my dad was diagnosed with ALL (Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia). This cancer was so rare that the doctors told him he had two weeks to live. How does this affect me, you ask? I mean, I was not even a thought bubble when he was diagnosed. Well, thirty three years later my dad is still here, but just three months ago, his current heart was beating in someone else’s chest. The extremely intense chemotherapy from his cancer had enlarged his heart three times its size. While the average person’s heart pumps out about 55-60% of the blood it contains every pump, my dad’s heart has been pumping out about 20% since his chemo. Because of this, he had a pacemaker/defibrillator put in his chest to regulate his heart. Regardless of this apparent handicap, he would always take me and my sisters to play tennis and golf and he has been taking me to Disney World every year since I was 12, although this year we were not able to go. While he had been such a strong person for most of my life, these past five years have been so hard for him. He and the doctors all thought it was just different medicines slowing him down and making him feel weak and tired, so all of his doctors just tried changing the medicines over and over again... (There is more to this and so I have attached the rest in the additional information section)","Please enjoy! :)

I clearly remember how confused I felt about what was going on, and all the medical terms that didn't make sense and how I felt like I never completely understood what was going on. I would really love to be that person that any of the kids feel they can talk to, even just for one person. I also just think this is such a unique experience, and that I, as well as the campers, can gain so much from this experience. I would love to see how they could grow in just one week. In high school, many of my leadership positions had me working with the sophomores at my school. I also was a part of a club that taught other high school students about different STEM topics. With the outdoors, in high school, I went camping with some friends in the summer, and I went camping and hiking with my godfather in Colorado two summers ago and during this Thanksgiving break.

Dates: July 2016
Description: volunteered at a summer camp at my school, where students in 6th, 7th, and 8th grade came every day for a week and learned about startups. We taught them the lifecycle of a startup and they formed groups and went through a simulation of how their company and idea would do as a startup. We had to guide them through the process and decisions and teach them the different concepts.","Role: Events Planner, Teen STEM Cafe
Dates: November 2015-May 2018 
Description:I helped charter a group called Teen STEM Café, where we brought in different speakers to talk to high school students in the surrounding area about different STEM topics. We would then hold breakout sessions, so the students could apply what they learned. During the end of my junior year, I decided to see if we could start bringing in middle school students, so they could be exposed to these topics and opportunities earlier. I think that was my biggest impact on this group because it changed who our targeted audience was. I also think that it showed the newer members that it’s okay to pivot or alter the initial idea or plans if you think something can be improved.

Role: Member, Maker Space
Dates: October 2015-May 2018
Description: I managed the Maker Space, which had 3D printers and pens, and other cool tech-y things. During my junior year, our club got a new manager, who was also new to the school, and he was not the most approachable person. I think my biggest impact in this group was how I spent 2 hours a week, during my shift, just talking to the manager, and trying to make him open up and see the students’ points of view. This space was supposed to be inclusive and allow anyone to learn how to use these machines, not just people who already know how to use them.","As I sit at my aunt’s kitchen table after the South Side Irish Parade, eating corned beef and drinking green river, I look around and listen. I see my family members, each in a different conversation, talking over each other, shouting across the table, cutting each other off, but still smiling and enjoying the festive day. Everyone’s wearing the green South Side sweatshirts covered in shamrocks, deely boppers, and temporary tattoos of leprechauns.

I love being surrounded by my family. Even during hard times, it’s just nice to know that all these people are there for me, from my 25 cousins to all my aunts and uncles, and all my cousins invite their friends. I just love being surrounded by a lot of people who I know truly care about my wellbeing. I love the festive environment and how any conversation is welcome. Any topic is welcome, both happy ones that promote questions such as how our year is going, summer plans, who is now in a relationship, and more upsetting topics that let us open up and talk to one another on a deeper level than we are able to through text. All questions are encouraged and all my older cousins are there to support and advise me, since I am the youngest. The festive atmosphere allows me to feel freer than when I have to go home and study for my next test or write my next paper. 
","I think three important things to know are 1) I value how approachable I try to make myself 2) I went to a boarding school while my mom was fighting cancer and 3) even though I am often scared or intimidated to try new things, I actually really enjoy doing them and the memories that come from them. Now I'll explain why I think these three things are important to know about me.

1) I think it's super important that all the counselors are important, but I also just think that in life, it's a good trait to have. Many times I was afraid to talk to someone else because I thought they would judge me or wouldn't understand what was going on in my life, so I really try to make it known that anyone can come to me and that I'm always willing to help or even just to listen. 

2) I think the fact that I went to a boarding school really influenced my experience with cancer. Even though I was old enough to understand what was going on with my mom, I wasn't home and so I never actually knew what was going on. It left me confused for the majority of my high school career.

3) I think that trying new things and stepping out of our comfort zones is important, especially as counselors in order to put ourselves in the kids' shoes when they're in a new environment and already going through so much. ","I would be super excited to do an activity where the kids write a letter to either their future selves. I think it's just a good way for them to reflect on how they're doing and then later see their progress or how things have changed. We could do this at the end of the camp, so they can also write about what they did so they forever have these memories. They could write about anything they want, seal the letter, and we could mail the letters out in a year or in a few years. ","I'm not even joking or lying, but this is the one activity that I really wanted to take part in when coming into Stanford. You could literally ask any of my friends. I found out about this camp when I visited the school my junior year of high school, which was when my mom was in the middle of her treatments. I then heard about it again during admit weekend from one of the upperclassmen I knew, and this was right after my mom passed away. I just felt like this was kind of a sign that I needed to take part in this. 

But also, I just want to be able to bring joy to any child's life while they're going through something that's so horrible. The idea of giving these kids even just one week where they don't have to constantly think about their parent's illness and they can just be kids fills me with so much joy. It's something that I would have loved to have. I would love to be able to a comforting presence and someone that the kids feel like they can go to with questions or stories or just to talk to because I know that sometimes it's nice to just have someone who at least kind of understands the situation and can empathize with them. But it's also nice to be somewhere where you don't HAVE to talk about what's going on if you don't feel comfortable or want to. ","I was adopted from China at the age of 1 by a lower middle, working class, Irish family, and have spent the rest of my life in a middle class suburb just outside of Chicago (like I'm literally two blocks outside of Chicago and it frustrates me so much that I can't just be from Chicago). I was able to attend a public boarding school in Illinois that was very academically competitive even though my family was not very well off. 

From an ethnic/racial perspective, I have always been confused what to say I am. I know I'm ""racially"" Chinese, but I don't think I'm ethnically Chinese. I have never been a part of that culture. But also, I am not white, even though my family is. I think this a unique perspective, but also a helpful one to use when considering bi-racial children or if anyone else happens to be adopted. 

Being from the lower middle class has actually been a challenge while at Stanford. Many of my peers do not know what it's like to worry about money and how much you spend. And it was very difficult while my mom was going through her treatments because the bills just racked up. I think this is very helpful because sometimes kids can be cruel when they don't understand someone else's situation, and many times kids don't want to admit that their family is not as well off as their peers'. ","I uploaded a document below.

I just wanted to show that I am willing to put in the time, work, and energy for this. I also wanted to show that I am willing to both try new things and go outside of my comfort zone, and that I think it is important to do those things. It teaches us things about ourselves, who we can be, and puts life into perspective. We all have our own fears, our own issues, and we're all in different situations, looking at the world differently and it's important to remember that.

PS I wasn't going to write this and I was just going to upload the picture and hope you got all of that out of the picture; however, it said I had to enter a value in this box, so I may as well use what I'm given.

","Role: Organizer and Leader of Gooch Elementary Summer JumpStart Camp
Dates: July 2014 – May 2017 (started after sophomore year)
Description: Worked with principal of Gooch Elementary to create and run the first academic summer camp for the students. While helping her create the curriculum, our primary focus was to help students stay on track for their reading and math grade level instead of fall behind during their time off.

Role: Counselor at Royal Oaks Tennis Camp
Dates: September 2017 - Present (started after senior year)
Description: Led tennis, swim, and fitness coaching for campers ages 7-13 at summer camp. Worked with them for 6+ hours a day for 8 weeks and managed leadership responsibilities with staff and fellow counselors.
","Role: National Student Poets Program
Dates: September 2016 - Present (started senior year)
Description: As one of five poets selected each year to represent their home regions, I spent my year traveling around the country to deliver readings, lead workshops, and engage new communities with poetry. I absolutely loved getting blend my passion for teaching and writing, and the people I met at poetry festivals and in schools have impacted my life in so many ways. Although there is a new class of poets, I’m still involved with the program, now more on the fund-raising, mentoring, and organizing side.

Role: Fellowships Lead for Stanford Social Entrepreneurial Students’ Association (SENSA)
Dates: September 2017 - Present (started freshman year)
Description: As the head of the Fellowships team, I work with social enterprises and start-ups to create summer internship opportunities for students interested in public service, technology, and the social sector. Last year, I worked on the marketing team to redesign the logo and grow the brand on campus.

Role: Teacher for Frosh 101
Dates: September 2017 - Present (started as student freshman year and teacher sophomore year)
Description: My freshman year, I took Frosh 101—a class on finding belonging and community on campus—in the fall, and at the end of the year, I was asked to teach it as a sophomore. This quarter, I lead a group of 8 freshmen from Rinconada in weekly classes that are designed to help them adjust to and thrive at Stanford.
","The room was nearly as dark as it was quiet, and I couldn’t hear anything except the faint crackle of crickets far away. My toes played with the beige rings of my aunt’s carpeted floors, and the small clock next to the TV glowed a bright 1:45. ""Gopal, don’t worry, just close your eyes and you’ll definitely fall asleep."" As my eyelids tried (and failed) to keep my eyes from opening, the only thought that ran through my mind was that my mom lied right to my face. And then, as if to wipe away any hope of sleep I had, my stomach started grumbling. But this grumble was like no other. It vibrated the air around me like an earthquake, and I knew, in that moment, that I wouldn’t be going to sleep anytime soon.

Looking up at the clock after the hunger-quake subsided, I saw the time was around 2:00 am, and I knew I couldn't be caught getting food right now (or at least getting food alone). So I slowly tip-toed over to my cousin and nudged him awake. The moment he saw my toothy grin, he knew what was up. It was time for the classic Gopal-Akil Midnight Snack ©. Always Reese’s Puffs and whole milk, and always just us two. Over the course of the three weeks we spent together that summer more than a decade ago, our midnight snacks made the 14-year age gap between us melt into a friendship like no other.
","I love working with kids, and my favorite part of teaching youth is the way their energy makes a space come alive. In high school, I organized my local elementary school’s tutoring program, and I worked with the principal to create a summer camp so the students could stay on track while school was out. Leading that camp showed me how much impact just one or two weeks can have on a kid’s life, and I’d love to continue creating experiences like these through Camp Kesem.

Creativity, compassion, and curiosity are my guiding principles. As a young kid, I tried and tried to express myself, but no matter how much my parents would attempt to feign their awe at my drawings, I could see right through it. I felt creatively constipated. In middle school, my amazing English teacher introduced me to the world of poetry, and soon, that became the bridge between my imagination and my physical world. It, over the past eight years, has helped me practice these three qualities in every interaction I have.  

No matter what my position may be, I view the role of an effective community member to bring humor and joy to their community. I consciously try to always be a source of warmth because at the end of the day, my interactions with all of my communities make up the bulk of my life, so being present and loving in these commitments in turn are what give me a happy and meaningful life.","Before 7th grade, I viewed poetry as something for only old people with gold monocles and white hairs popping out their ears. During my senior year, I traveled around the country to teach young students about poetry, and I focused on helping them see the world of poetry as a fun and familiar place. In Kesem, I’d love to teach the campers how to use poetry as a tool for defining their own narratives. When you hear the word “poet,” chances are, you probably don’t picture young kid scribbling outdoors at a summer camp. I want to change that.","I’m so eager to join a community like Camp Kesem that centers joy and compassion as its two fundamental and guiding values. In so many organizations, leaders forget to place these priorities as the pillars of the foundation, and so the community eventually becomes about something else, something less tied to its members’ happiness. My favorite part about Kesem is that my role as a counselor is to make my campers feel as included, safe, and joyful as can be, and that is such a life-giving goal to have. Volunteering my time to Kesem is not just me giving my time up for someone else’s benefit—it’s me pouring energy into a community that would, in turn, give me so much joy and allow me to bring light into others’ lives.  

From organizing summer camps to individual tutoring to coaching, most of my most cherished experiences have come from serving the youth from my communities, and I am so, so excited craft new ones with Kesem’s counselors and campers. As a counselor, I would bring everything I’ve learned from teaching young kids poetry, tennis, and even math to every activity I help lead, and I’m confident that I can help make the camp a more bubbly, interesting, and loving place. The biggest reason for working at Kesem, for me, is that it would mean joining a community that will help me grow as a leader, teacher, and friend while serving a cause I deeply believe in.","Ever since I began to grapple with my identity, I started to realize that I occupy a unique space between two worlds—that of my parents’ native home in India and that of the America I have always lived in. For the longest time, I ignored my ancestors’ narratives and instead tried to constrain my identity to solely my American identity. Unknowingly, I had left undiscovered a vast and beautiful part of my life. But the more I grew close to my grandma, I picked up little scalpels and flashlights along the way and finally took some time to excavate my family’s history.

Once I rejoined my family’s cultural tradition, so many facets of our lives became clear to me. The sheer size of our extended family. The insistence on visiting the same friends over and over and over. Even the reticence and hesitation of speaking about my mother’s cancer scare. So much of my personality is driven by these parts of my culture, and learning how to grapple with a multitude of identities has been pivotal in learning how to think about who I am. At Kesem, I hope to be a mentor and source of support for campers as they go through times of unpacking and considering their own emotional and cultural histories. I firmly believe in the power of storytelling to help children relate to narratives that extend beyond their lives, and I’d love to help them take on roles as storytellers for their families.
","I wrote this poem, “To make a hand,” as a way for me to explore lyrically what it must be like to really take care of and nurture a life that isn’t my own. It is an exploration of what it means to be a caring counselor, a caring parent, and a caring child, all rolled into one narrative.

To make a hand

you need to find the bones. The right ones are like 
the moon—snow white, cratered, just out of 		reach.

Then, walk to a garden. Breathe in the smallest rose
you can find, and rub your thumb on the thorn.

String in hand, touch the needle to your bloom-
ing finger and stitch the petals into shape.

Now, turn around to listen for the creek’s giggle. 
Sit at her feet and pick up a little raw pebble.

Shake off its dripping past, and press it into the 
patchwork palm, stone sinking into blushing skin.

At last, dig up a bone of your own, a small one,
one that you rarely remember.

Press this into the fingers and carve with your body
something new, something a-part from yourself.

Place the pearl chisel into the budding tips, 
and let your hand set the new one down.

Pull out of your chest your heartbeat, your pulse,
your life, and place it in the hand knowing, no 
longer wondering, how to make a life.

Backpacking or roaming in the outdoors in general presents a lot of opportunity to engage in close conversation with others and talk about things that might seem weird to bring up over a sit-down meal. With regards to outdoor experience, I'm honestly a little rusty, but participated in a 3-day camping trip my senior year of high school and a weekend camping trip (for section leading retreat) my freshman year of college. I'm generally a very active person and would rather be moving than sitting still most of the time. My experience with this age group has mostly been through academic activity, but I think it would be a lot of fun to come up with outdoor activities to bring these campers together and engage with non-academic topics.","Role: Co-Director @ Splash!

",N/A,"My first service experience at Stanford was probably joining the Global Brigades chapter at Stanford. Months of medical preparation led to a service trip to a rural village in Nicaragua to provide medical relief during spring break of my freshman year.  It was immensely humbling and eye-opening to experience what life is like in a completely different part of the world. I was most struck by the conversations in Spanish I was able to have with local adults and kids who told me that they wished for a life with more opportunity. Those moments only confirmed and continue to fuel my desire to use my privileged position to give back to the best of my ability.

I was motivated by this international experience to continue working in healthcare, this time at a non-profit that redistributes unused medicine called SIRUM. I worked closely with the co-founders to start the first insulin donation program in California. I stayed at SIRUM in total for nine months, during which I was also able to visit SIRUM's charitable pharmacy in Oregon where I logged medicine for two weeks. Logging medicine was actually really impactful at the time because we had a shortage of loggers and so many donations were coming in every week. My experiences at this non-profit really taught me the value of being scrappy and getting things done.

Finally, I am part of Tzu Chi, a global humanitarian organization dedicated to helping wherever is needed with its incredible army of volunteers. I have served at the Ronald McDonald House, at a homeless shelter in Sunnyvale, and recently in a flower arrangement workshop to thank the janitors and custodians that are behind the scenes of the facilities we enjoy daily. Just the weekend before Thanksgiving break, I went up to Chico with some fellow members to serve at a disaster relief center for the fire victims. I continue to be blown away by how selfless Tzu Chi members are, and I strive to follow in their relentless desire to do good.","I used to watch VCR tapes (these don’t exist anymore, or they do in museums) of old Chinese drama series with my grandma. Honestly, those were some of the best moments of my life. I loved the kung fu scenes, the snaky people in the emperor’s palace, the costumes, the long-winding plot, and so much more. Every weekend, I would look forward to my parents bringing home the next set of episodes (we rented them from a Chinese “Blockbuster”) and binge watch for the rest of the following week. I didn’t just gain poor eyesight from this experience though. Because I started this activity when I was about two (and went til about nine when VCRs died), I actually learned to read Chinese along the way by connecting the Chinese subtitles to the spoken words of the actors. Didn’t completely waste my childhood, I guess.","I like to take walks by myself and with other people to spend some time reflecting and to take a step back from all the business of school. 

I’m always hungry for adventure and looking for the next thing to do with others. Interacting with people I can connect with is honestly my greatest joy in life. 

I’m a listener at heart. I like listening to people’s stories, complaints, days, rambling, and dreams. There are so many perspectives in this world, and I can only try to hear all of them. I do contribute of course from time to time, but usually after I’ve listened.
","I would be really excited to teach Avalon, a role playing game for seven or more people. It’s like Mafia but a hundred times better because every person has a bit more information on average. It’s a game of not only lie and deception, but also (betrayed) alliances and teamwork. I think the campers would have a lot of fun playing Avalon for an hour or two.

","I’ve actually wanted to volunteer at Camp Kesem for the past three years, but something always came up. Now in my last year, I made sure to plan ahead to keep Camp Kesem week free. I want to volunteer my time because I just resonate so much with the camp’s mission and its commitment to brightening the lives of children who are going through very intense periods in their lives that they shouldn’t have to go through alone. As someone with family members who are going through and have gone through cancer, I know firsthand how difficult it is to share that experience with others. In fact, I don’t think I’ve talked about it at all with anyone outside of my family and even with people who are close relatives. I see Camp Kesem as creating a safe and open space for talking about these issues, and more importantly, for coming together to celebrate the joys of friendship and life. I just want to help as much as I can to make this happen. 

","I come from a family of immigrants who had to work very hard to make sure that I have the life that I do. As mentioned earlier, I have personal experience with relatives who are going through and have battled cancer, which gives me some perspective on what the campers have to go through. I also study a weird combination of philosophy and computer science, and generally like talking about both humanities and science subjects. ","""Make the ordinary come alive"" by William Martin

Do not ask your children
to strive for extraordinary lives.
Such striving may seem admirable,
but it is the way of foolishness.
Help them instead to find the wonder
and the marvel of an ordinary life.
Show them the joy of tasting
tomatoes, apples and pears.
Show them how to cry
when pets and people die.
Show them the infinite pleasure
in the touch of a hand.
And make the ordinary come alive for them.
The extraordinary will take care of itself.", (https://hillelatstanford.wufoo.com/cabinet/enlrZWg3azE3amFrMmk=/sKOFzc5w2vI%3D/),Glenn Yu,11/6/18, (https://hillelatstanford.wufoo.com/cabinet/enlrZWg3azE3amFrMmk=/sKOFzc5w2vI%3D/),Glenn Yu,11/6/18,12/5/18 0:23,public,12/6/18 1:38,public,128.12.252.4,6,1

The majority of my experience with children has been through the two communities I was the most involved with growing up, the Vancouver Water Ski Club and the West Vancouver Field Hockey Association. Each provided me with ample opportunities and motivation to engage with children through sports. With the VWSC, I volunteered regularly at their annual summer camp and SkiAbility events. SkiAbility is a programed designed to give disabled individuals the ability to learn and practice watersports safely, and the summer kids camp is an annual event for children to learn various watersports. With the WVFHA, I was a coach for their summer and fall developmental kids camps for 3 years as well as a coach for a U13 recreational team.
","
During the summers of 2013 through 2015, I worked at the Vancouver Water Ski Club’s weeklong summer camp for kids. The children ranged from 5-15 years old with varying levels of experience in watersports. The primary goal of the camp was to promote the love of the sport and improve their individual skill. My first year I was employed as the dock manager, which entailed giving dry land training, fitting each camper with the necessary gear, and more often than not, persuading them to get into the water. I found that the novice 5-7 year old group was always the most challenging as many of the campers were frightened by the idea of being behind a boat. The following years I was employed as a counsellor, which brought with it a whole new set of responsibilities. A wet dock and excited children is a recipe for an accident and my primary role as a counsellor was to uphold the safety and wellbeing of the campers. Working at this camp was always my favourite part of the summer as I felt like I was always able to truthfully connect with the campers. I really felt like these kids were my siblings by the end of the week. 
","
Over the years I have had many meaningful volunteer experiences although there have been three that have significantly stood out. Touching again on the Vancouver Water Ski Club, I was privileged to have the opportunity to be apart of their SkiAbility Program. SkiAbility was one of the most rewarding events I have ever participated in, as I was able to provide individuals with an experience that most had never dreamed of. The majority of the children were physically disabled, some paraplegic, and the idea of water skiing had never crossed their mind. Due to the extreme nature of watersports, a real bond of trust was created between participant and instructor, as one wrong move could be potentially fatal. Recognizing this, I decided to expand the liberties of my position as dry land coach and jump into the water with each participant. I kept them company in the water and physically guided them upright until they plateaued above the water. Although it was very physical volunteer work, the sheer joy that I saw on the faces of the participants was worth every minute. 

Additionally, I was a member of my High school’s Christmas hamper program where we collected clothes, food, and presents for families in need. I was given the opportunity to deliver my class’s Christmas hamper my senior year and I was blown away by the effects of such a small gesture. Upon driving to the recipient’s house I was nervous about the sizing on the clothes and whether or not they would like the specific type of pasta we packed. Yet, when I met the mother at the door, her gracious and humble look calmed all of my worries. Those trivial specifications did not matter; just to receive anything at all was incredible. This experience was very valuable to me as it often reminds me that the act of aid and giving is often more powerful than the gift itself. 

Lastly, a group that I hold near to my heart is my Highschool’s field hockey team. Being a player for 4 years and a leader for 2, I was very involved with the program. I learned a great deal about teamwork, friendship and family along the way. After half the team had graduated during my junior year, my fellow captain and I realized that making new members feel welcome was necessary for success. We organized countless team bonding activates, pre game rituals, and even tutored some of the players to keep our minds sharp and spirits high. Against all odds, we ended up winning the provincial championship that year. I have been apart of many competitions and teams throughout my life but that group is the only that I am still in touch with. The connections created and memories shared that year are some of my most valued friendships.  
","One of my favourite childhood memories is more humorous than heartfelt. It takes place 7 years ago when my family decided that we would rent a tent trailer and go camping in the interior of British Columbia. With high hopes we drove east in this strange contraption (half tent half car) and arrived at a trailer park. The next morning, however, was not so peaceful.
I awoke with my sister accidently kicking me in my newly pierced ear. I looked around and there was blood everywhere, but somehow not from me. The refrigerator in the trailer had broken during the night and all the frozen meat had thawed, and leaked, all over the floor.  My mom began launching soggy groceries out of the trailer with the rest of us. Adding fuel to the fire, a swarm of wasps began to crowd around the food. It was this image that my father returned to after his morning jog. Upon seeing him, we all paused, and burst into laughter. To this day I don’t think I have ever laughed that hard. 
Later that day we ditched the trailer, and had the best week of our lives. I believe it was the horrific start that made us realize that all our regular arguments were insignificant. I think it was the best my family had ever gotten along. Looking back, I could remember this event with the tears, the pain, and the destruction of a trailer although I really only remember the laughter. 
","Always a difficult question, yet three things I think you should know about me is that I am Canadian, I have a deep connection with music and I am a relentlessly optimistic. ","I would love to teach astronomy at camp. I am unaware of the camp's location or the camper’s schedule but I believe it would be a fun and educational thing to facilitate. I have been a member of the Stanford Astronomical Society for two years now and I have found a lot of joy in teaching people about the stars during our on and off campus star gazing events.  I am actually currently studying aeronautics and astronautics because somebody took the time to inspire me about the cosmos and I would really love to do the same for others. 


","Truthfully, I would like to volunteer my time to Camp Kesem because its community. After speaking with many of the current leaders I have realized that everyone involved is connected by incredible amounts of love. Love for the campers, love for the families and love for each other. I believe the opportunity to be apart of such a healthy community is rare and I am honoured to even get the chance to apply. ",,"I chose to draw Lilo for Lilo and Stich because it was my favourite movie from my childhood. Containing so many life lessons, the quote I have chosen in my drawing I believe embodies the values of Camp Kesem. Including everyone in your family, leaving nobody left out or behind.

","Each summer, all sides of the Gordan family convene at Cape Cod for two glorious weeks. Us, the children, only see each other for these two weeks a year, but - the rest of the year forgotten - we are once again best friends.

My favorite tradition on Cape Cod has been unfortunately dubbed “the trashcan game.” The rules of the game: adults, children, and pets are divided into two teams; a giant green bin is rolled into the center of the lawn; one team must guard the trashcan for five minutes; and the other team must touch the trashcan before five minutes has passed.

Our family is notoriously competitive. One Gordan fable says that Uncle Mike actually hid INSIDE the (thankfully, empty) trashcan, winning the game before it started. My favorite tactic has been named the “the Mosquito.” All members of the offensive team hide behind the hedges on top of the hill and when someone shouts, “The mosquitos are eating me alive!” everyone charges down the hill, screaming and whooping, hoping to overpower the trashcan guards by sheer number.

Now, the kids are all in college and the trashcan has retired to its rightful job. I look back at the trashcan game fondly -- and at all the times our ridiculous schemes made us laugh until our stomachs hurt. Our little band of children made a game out of nothing, and I will always equate true freedom with running barefoot through the lawn in pursuit of a trashcan! ","1. I still color the children’s menus at restaurants.
What I mean by that is -- though I’m 20 -- I’m still really attached to the parts of myself that make me a child. My little brother is now 16, but we still play Chutes and Ladders together. I like to be really silly. My family likes to say I’m fluent in whale. There is a resilience, a happy-go-lucky attitude, and a curiosity that I don’t want to outgrow, even as I continue to mature.

2.  I pride myself on being trustworthy.
Trustworthiness is the trait that I value the most in other people, so I try to display it myself. I have found that ensuring that I am trustworthy has carried over to other areas. So that I can be an individual others can trust and turn to, I have become a better listener; as I have had more open conversations, I have become increasingly empathetic to those around me.

3. I love talking to strangers.
I aspire to be the type of person that always befriends the person behind them in line. I am outgoing and I love getting to know new people. Once, that person behind me in line turned out to be a professional soccer player from Ireland! You never know what you will learn from the people around you.
","A buddy program where new-comers to the camp are paired with veterans of the camp. These buddy pairings could get together for a 30 minute check-in once a day so that the new-comers feel welcome, can vent concerns to a camper who has felt what it’s like to be “a new kid” before, and so they have a friend (especially at the beginning of camp!). 
It also might be cool to have a more general buddy program, where all younger kids are paired with an older buddy who they can relate to and spend one-on-one time with. 
","First and foremost, I love working with children. Their energy energizes me; their silliness helps me to be silly; their resilience helps me to be more resilient. Throughout high school I prioritized volunteering with children, but somehow in the craziness of college this aspect of my life slipped through the cracks. Camp Kesem provides a wonderful opportunity to volunteer with children once again, while contributing to a cause I care a lot about.

Last year, my grandmother was diagnosed with cancer, and subsequently went into palliative care. I was fortunate that I was close enough to home that I got to spend time with her nearly every day, but I was also fortunate that I had campus to retreat to when my grandmother’s situation became too emotionally intense. Kesem children shoulder a much heavier burden: not only are/have their parents been affected, but they can’t retreat from the situation like I did. I want to be able to help provide a tiny bit of escape through Camp Kesem -- and mold a place where they can simultaneously vent their stresses and forget their worries.
	
Lastly, everyone who has worked at Kesem has spoken to the incredible inclusivity and warmth of the Kesem community. It seems like a place that encourages you to explore your identity, get in touch with your emotions, and be yourself. That is a community that I want to be a part of and that I think I can add to.
","When I was in high school, I suffered a series of concussions that forced me out of school for a year. At that time, scientists and doctors knew little about concussions, and recommended full cognitive rest until I stopped having headaches. I followed their orders -- I watched no television, I read no books, and I turned off my cell-phone. For months, I sat in a dark room and just thought, a lot. I learned a lot about myself and I gained a TON of gratitude for things in my life I had once taken for granted. 

But, the year I took off from school was isolating. Stuck at home, it was easy to imagine that I was the only person in the world who had suffered concussions and been forced to take time off from school. It wasn’t until I had healed and began reaching out into the community that I realized that there were many in similar positions -- who had felt as alone as I had. I can imagine that children whose parents have been affected by cancer may experience similar feelings of isolation. They may feel that their friends and peers do not fully understand their home situation, and that they are the only child with this burden. I wish I’d had a support system of peers when I was recovering from my injuries, and so I hope to foster relationships within the children of Kesem so that they do not feel alone in their experience!

","Born and raised in Pheonix, Arizona,  I was around age seven when my family first visited the 'vortexs' in Sedona, Arizona. At first, I hated the idea of going; as a little computer nerd, I didn't want to leave my safe indoors. And as a child growing up in Arizona, the outside is painfully hot. But those hills felt like they had a magical energy all of their own. Scaling the rough red-rock of the vortex, breathing fresh air, I felt close to nature for the first time.  
Trying new things can be fun and embracing change is essential. I went into the experience miserable and rigid, I left remembering Sedona as one of the greatest locations I've ever visited. ","I don't like reminiscing in my past more than is necessary. Heading to college, I decided to let go of the weights holding me down and live my life free. It appears I succeeded. 
I now live life for the individual moments. Each day my to-do list includes some variation of: ""Smile"", ""be happy"", ""laugh loud"", and ""love something new"". I try to keep a smile on my face at all times.
For now, I live on serendipity. Let life take me where it will and love the experience. 
I am still trying to find myself, but for now, I am happy being who I am, smiling as I find myself.","I love the water; swimming, paddle boarding, boating, surfing, anything in the water is my happy place. I would love to teach the kids water safety and bring them out on (or in) the water, hopefully making the water a happy place for them. ","As a kid, I needed an adult that would look out for me and show me that the world isn't so bad -- to show me how to laugh in the face of adversity and smile through the bad times and the good.

Additionally, I greatly admire Phil ""Cowboy"" Montgomery. I've seen how happy camp counseling makes him and how fulfilled he is by the opportunity to help. The joy counseling brings him and the joy it allows him to bring others is something I hope to experience for myself. ","When I am asked about my religion, I always respond in the same, cryptic way: I am a Jewish Catholic Agnostic Buddhist. In other words, I do not know. I am still trying to figure out my beliefs. I am unafraid to admit that I do not know. I think there are many kids who feel as I do, who are lost and trying to find there way. I can show them that the state they are in is natural; that they don't have to know all the answers or ascribe to one belief over another. I want to show them that they can find meaning on their own. ","I like writing poetry. Below is one I wrote recently: 

Historic grounds older than time
Pocketed marks of ages Past 
Untouched Present, scarred remembrance
Remains unmoving for Future’s hurt 

Molten rocks, scattered mossy gashes
Ashen clad fingers stretch skyward
Reveal smoke tendrils, grasping higher
Battlefield torn; forgotten war

Salt-stain blade, cut forlorn crevices:
memories best buried below —
Concealed by semblance overgrowth
Comes haunted bones riding home

Children’s drip-drop assault the sky
Cavernous carefree hideaway,  
White topped human influence 
Bringing forth tragedies lost lore

Monumental mounds meet mighty sea 
On blackened sands, with half-life clouds
Colors cascade across heaven

He was the parent that worked from home to raise me and my siblings, and during the summer he would take us on all of his errands around town with him.

Those days of innocence were and simple joy have stuck with me over the years, and I often long to go back to those days. ","1. My father passed away from small cell lung cancer when I was 13 years old. To this day, he is still my hero.

3. My ultimate career goal is to become a licensed clinical social worker and work specifically with children. My greatest passion in life is working with children in need.
",I would be excited to help encourage children in the areas of hope and resilience. I have always hoped that by sharing my personal life experience with losing my father to cancer that I could help other children in the same unfortunate position.,"I want to volunteer my time at Camp Kesem because I relate so directly with the kids. Losing my father to cancer was the most pivotal point in my life, and I have learned so much from that experience that I strongly believe I would be doing the children at this camp a huge disservice if I did not volunteer to be there. Cancer is an evil beast, and while it destroys lives it is important to remember that it is limited. It can only destroy what people allow it to. It cannot steal love, joy, hope, and family if individuals are properly equipped to fight. These kids need to be given the tools to handle the tragic circumstances of cancer in their family, and I know that I can help to teach them. ","As mentioned above, I have unique life experiences as an army veteran who has done two tours overseas. Additionally, I am the child of an immigrant mother that was left to raise myself and my siblings in a single parent household after cancer took my father from us. Being in a situation where my mother was an immigrant and my American born father passed away, my family was fairly isolated and we did not have access to resources to help us process his death. It was not until much later in life that I was able to learn the coping mechanisms and other useful techniques and lessons to help me deal with his loss and the memories of the time that her was sick. I would have loved the opportunity to attend a camp like Camp Kesem when I was a kid; and I believe that my unique experience with cultural struggles, cancer, the military, and previous work with children makes me an excellent candidate with much to contribute. ","Cancer can hurt you, it can affect all.
It can find you whether you're big or you're small.

It can make you feel bad and really quite blue,
But I can tell you what cancer can't do.

It can't steal your hope, your love, or your might.
It also can't steal your ability to fight.

It might make mom or dad sick, or take them away,
But it can't take their memories that are in your heart to stay.

So though cancer is bad when it makes it's way in,
You can fight for your joy and not let it win.

","Role: Music Director for AATP's production of The Last 5 Years - 
Date: Winter Quarter 2018
Description: Music has always been a huge part of my life, and I became a serious musician at age 12. While I did not perform as much as I would have liked to during my freshman year of college, my experience allowed me to become a music director. Because I was a freshman, I was a little scared and lost when it came to being assertive with my orchestra and handling logistics, however the role forced me out of my shell and showed me the importance of organization and assertiveness while still having fun with my peers. It showed me how amazing things can be when everyone -- musicians, actors, lighting designers, sound designers -- try their hardest to work with each other's best interests at heart, rather than just their own. It was difficult job, but I learned a lot.

Painting - I didn’t consider myself a visual artist until this year. I always loved museums and galleries, but I never took my own doodles seriously. This year I learned how to use oil paints. With that I found a new way to express myself and keep track of my emotions. Also being in a class with people’s who’s art I never would have appreciated before forced me to find the good things in everyone's work, even if I personally didn’t enjoy it. I’ve also learned that no one really has a say in what’s bad art and what’s good art, and all art doesn’t have to look a certain way. I think this applies to life in many ways.
","One of my favorite memories from childhood is during my first piano recital at age 7. My mom and grandfather were there supporting me as always, and I was all dressed up and ready to perform, and strangely enough, I didn’t feel any of the nervousness that I occasionally get now as a more professional player. I remember being called up to play, and I played a very basic version of Row, Row, Row Your Boat, probably the very same rendition that you played if you also took beginning piano lessons. I struggled with piano, but rather than having trouble with the keys, I had trouble reading the notes in time, so I distinctly remember scowling at the sheet music before me for the entire duration of the song. I don’t even think I blinked. 

The song was choppy and out of time, but as soon as I was done I received a standing ovation. Looking back, of course I didn’t sound amazing; I was seven years old. But for some reason, this room full of strangers, mostly parents and relatives of the other piano students, all decided to stand up and applaud me, and I’ve never forgotten it. This just goes to show that cheering someone on and recognizing where they are trying and overcoming their challenges can impact their lives in an unforeseen way.
","I’m strong-willed, I’m willing to learn, and I believe in being warm towards everyone.","I would love to lead some painting/drawing projects with broad prompts like “paint what you’re feeling today” so that we can allow the campers some time for expression and consideration of their emotions. Also I’m a sports official for softball, volleyball, and basketball so I would be all for facilitating some games if we have the facilities for that (maybe campers versus counselors?) We can also do an air band competition, where campers get to lip sync to a (clean) song of their choice, and three of the counselors can be judges and give fun/funny feedback like on American Idol!  ","I’m very familiar with losing someone during childhood. My father passed away a few months before I was born. My grandmother had Alzheimer's, so she and my grandfather moved into my Mom’s house with us when I was 7 before she passed away when I was 11 after battling the disease. Then, during my junior year of high school, my grandfather, my father figure, went through two amputations before passing away in February of 2016.

Experiencing illness and death like this at such a young age affected me in a wide range of ways. Some days I felt like life was so unfair that it was pointless. I didn’t want to talk about these deaths with anyone, and I tried to pretend like I was okay. Other days I felt empowered, because if I had lived through the deaths of the people closest to me, I could live through anything. 

The way that I felt (and feel) about these things changes everyday. No one copes in a uniform way, especially not children. Sometimes children don’t want to talk about it, sometimes they do. Sometimes they want to cry, sometimes they just want to reflect.

Becoming so conscious of mortality at a young age is weird, and I’m still young, so I don't  have it all figured out. But I think that I can relate to these kids and the way that they may think about life. And who knows, maybe they’ll teach me something about life as well. 
","My most of my “diverse” experiences are highlighted throughout my application, but to be blunt, I am a black woman raised in a predominantly white area of California by a single mother with an income that would be considered slightly above low. I’ve been teased about it all; having dark skin, having “weird” hair, having no dad, and having weird clothes. A lot of times, people that didn’t experience these things don’t know how to deal with them when they’re happening to other people. Again, I’m not claiming to know all the answers, but I at least have somewhat of an idea of what a camper may want to hear if they experience any negativity because I’ve lived through it.

Dates: Oct. 2014-current
Description: I work closely with the Special Olympics non-profit organization. In high school, I programmed seasonal events for S.O. athletes. At Stanford, I founded the Stanford Special Olympics Program to build a connection between our community and Bay Area Special Olympics.","Ever since I was little, my mother has taken me on a Leaf Walk every autumn. As the aspen leaves change from green, to gold, to Cardinal Red, my mom always makes a point to spend time with her children hiking in the mountains and admiring what she calls “Nature’s Gifts.” When I was 8 years-old, I looked up at my mom and asked her why she liked the leaves so much. She smiled with her typical loving kindness and remarked, “The colors remind me how lucky I am to have such colorful children.” I distinctly remember that moment as a perfect portrayal of her warmhearted personality and role as my mentor. These autumn hikes, simple and sweet, bring her immense joy, so long as she enjoys them with her children. I will never forget this life lesson.

My mother is the most inspirational figure in my life - my best friend. She has selflessly and graciously paved every path to my personal success and happiness. I am forever thankful for her impact. I look forward to one day taking my children on an annual Leaf Walk to appreciate Nature’s Gifts and my mom. Until then, I model my own compassion for others off her big-hearted approach to life. I am lucky to have such a colorful mentor in my life, and I always strive to contribute to my peers in similar ways. ","I love making friends. A firm believer in “You’re only as good as the people you surround yourself with,” I cherish the opportunity to meet new people and build friendships. My mom tells me I used to make friends with everyone I could while playing at park. As I get older, I take that to heart more and more. I like to make people feel included and valued, because that’s what I look for in a friend. Wherever I go, whatever I’m doing, life is better with friends.

I am driven to give back all that has been given to me. I am fortunate to have an awesome supportive system, a roof over my head, and a college that values my goals. So many amazing people have created opportunities for me along the way. As a mentor, volunteer, tutor, and friend, my main goal is to ensure others feel even more comfortable and supported.  

I am a super positive person. Kinda my MO, I just really value happiness and optimism. It has gotten me through the toughest times in my life, and I believe it’s a refreshing perspective to have when my friends need help. As someone with mental illness in my family, I recognize that not everyone can always have a cheery disposition. Sometimes it’s more important to prioritize self care. And sometimes it’s just flat-out easier to be critical. But truly, that motivates me to appreciate my personal positivity and work to help others find theirs.
","Juggling! I love to juggle so much I even wrote my Common App essay about it (true story). I appreciate the simple complexity of creating a juggling cascade, and the endless life metaphors associated with the skill (juggling your identities/priorities, sometimes you drop the ball, etc.). I’ve taught seven friends/family how (I keep a running list). At first learning to juggle can seem daunting, but with careful teaching and some practice you’ll be a pro (this time I don’t need a parenthetical, but figured I’d say hey anyway. How’s your day goin’? Do you know how to juggle?).","I would love the opportunity to add my fun-loving personality to mix at Camp Kesem! In Kesem, I see a community that reflects my personal values of high-spirited fun and loving kindness. I am someone who wants to listen, learn, and make people smile. I want to make friends, build connections, and help others in any way I can. I see a one-of-a-kind chance to do that as a Kesem counsellor. 

At Stanford, there is a tendency to participate in self-serving activities (IMO). We are all incredible individuals who do incredible things! But a little too often we fill our days with activities and opportunities centered around ourselves. I want to break this trend. There is room for more selflessness in my life, and I want to hone my attentiveness towards others. Many Kesem counsellors have told me about experiences from camp that moved them to tears (many times ‘happy tears’). I want to share those experiences. I want to smile, laugh, and cry while growing as a listener and a friend.

In high school, a close mentor of mine often used the acronym: OMAH, or Open Mind And Heart. If lucky enough to become a Kesem counsellor, I promise to approach camp with an OMAH. Cancer is scary, and confusing, and emotionally taxing. Those emotions are not reserved for any specific age group. With an OMAH, I hope to lead by example and encourage fellow counsellors/campers to be vulnerable, supportive, and kind-hearted.
","I come from an economically challenged background. Of course, there are inherent disadvantages in being the oldest child in a family of divorce when one parent is on Social Security and the other has untreated health complications. To be entirely real, I face financial burdens that are bigger than me, and out of my control. I am tasked with the challenge of managing my personal expenses, ensuring I have enough money for tuition, and also trying to provide for my family at home (groceries, gas money, etc.). As a 19 year-old college student in this unique situation, I put a lot of pressure on myself to give everything I have to my loved ones.

Clearly, I had to grow up fast. I’m not willing to let my siblings grow up as fast, and I firmly believe no child should ever have to. The unfortunate reality is many children with only one parental provider - many campers at Kesem - do. They do live financially unstable lives, and they do carry the burdens that come with that challenge. That’s not fair. 

But! I have also learned that confiding in trusted mentors and seeking guidance helps. If chosen to attend Camp Kesem, I would be honored to help any campers who battle these complicated, daunting financial realities. I would be humbled to lead by example in showing the campers that even though these challenges may be bigger than us, they are not bigger than our will to succeed and help others. 
","Attached you’ll find an original Crayon drawing that my Kids with Dreams buddy Simon and I made last winter. “SpongeBob Ross” is a playful piece that fuses two friendly childhood faces, Spongebob and Bob Ross. I had a blast drawing with Simon, and now I would love to take my playful drawing “skills” to Camp Kesem!",img_7851.jpeg.jpg (https://hillelatstanford.wufoo.com/cabinet/9cfb4643-bb9d-46b6-8bc1-b0c807c39a57),George Kingston,1/11/99, (https://hillelatstanford.wufoo.com/cabinet/enlrZWg3azE3amFrMmk=/wqnDiIuQlY0%3D/),George Kingston,1/11/99,12/5/18 17:03,public,12/5/18 17:21,public,128.12.253.7,6,1

I also taught a lot of leadership skills classes as part of student government. My favorite thing about talking to students of this age group is that they're just beginning to see themselves as individuals in a community/world context- it's exciting to be there as they make that discovery. ","STEAM4Students Founder and Lead Teacher
Dates: September 2016- May 2018 (junior and senior years of high school)

My most significant experience working with children would be through the organization I started in high school, STEAM4Students. This organization was dedicated to bringing science, technology, engineering, art, and math education to fourth and fifth-grade students through an after school program. Our motto was “By students, for students,” so all of our classes were taught by high school students for elementary schoolers. We designed our curriculum to include hands-on, interactive activities and projects. Some of my favorite activities were learning about DNA by extracting banana DNA, or about chemical compounds by making silly putty, or just doing engineering bridge competitions. I taught twice a month to a classroom of twenty-five loud, rambunctious, brilliant kids during my junior year, and during my senior year I helped expand the program to three other elementary schools from my hometown. I spent a lot of time teaching and being with with my students, and while it was challenging to manage such a large group at times, their impact on my life was worth it. 
","I have never worked at a summer camp, but I have attended a few throughout my childhood that were pretty meaningful to me and make up some of my best summer memories.
","Miss CEO Ambassador & Lead Organizer for Miss CEO Gilroy

Dates: June 2016- August 2016
 I was the first high school ambassador for Miss CEO, a women’s leadership development organization. I started this program in response to the lack of leadership training in my hometown, and because of my personal desire for a community of young women leaders. I started a summer program for high school girls in my hometown, Gilroy, CA, in the summer of 2016. I recruited professional women from across the Bay Area to come help us learn leadership skills like negotiation, networking, effective communication, and goal-setting. The outcome of this program is that we all walked away with a more comprehensive set of leadership skills to tackle our biggest goals and challenges- with a community of supportive female leaders to back us up. 
(Our summer was documented at www.missceogilroy.weebly.com) 

TEDx Lead Organizer

August 2017- April 2018
During my senior year, I worked to create the first TEDxYouth event in my hometown. Our goal was to create a space where youth could speak about what they found important: art, music, science, world issues, philosophy, or just their perspective on life. Our TEDx event was successful (and you can find our speaker videos online!), but it took a very intense year of planning on behalf of the youth organizing team. As for my impact, I was the lead organizer for the project, and I hope my team and I were able to make a lasting change in Gilroy by connecting our speakers to regular high school students, and allowing our speakers to empower the youth audience.

Interact Club

Dates: September 2014 - May 2018
I was very involved in the Interact Club at my high school, acting as a general member, then Vice President my junior year and President my senior year. This club was dedicated to providing service opportunities to students, and we ran service projects and activities like collecting clothing and other products for under-resourced schools in the area. We also connected our local club to international issues through raising money for organizations like the International Rescue Committee.

","When I was little, I really, really believed in fairies. I mean, there was absolutely no doubt in my mind that they existed. And, I knew for a fact that they lived in my backyard.
I think I was about eight when I decided to dig a hole to Neverland.
Don’t ask my why I thought I could dig a hole to Neverland. I have no idea. I just decided that the hole would be dug behind my mom’s rose bushes, and every day, I'd take a shovel to the bushes and dig. I think I managed to keep my project a secret from my parents for at least a week, at which point I remember the hole being enormous (but was probably actually about six inches deep). When they found out, they took the shovel away and my plan was scrapped.
That didn’t end my determination to communicate with the fairies, though. I'd build little fairy houses from acorn caps and tell stories to the trees and make up secret languages with the animals in my backyard. While those whimsical moments from my past are now gone, I think they left me with an ability to see so much magic and charm in life. I may not be able to communicate with fairies, but beautiful relationships and laughter and the strange way the world has of bringing you exactly what you need? That’s real-life magic, and that’s everywhere.
","1) I believe wholeheartedly in creating spaces where people can be seen as they are, as they want to be seen. I believe in understanding people in their own context, in the power of really listening, and in asking “why.” 
2) My favorite thing is Cookie Butter. If you’ve never had it, that needs to change. I can eat it straight out of the jar.
3) My friends tell me I have terrible music taste :) I listen to sing-y, dance-y music: just now, I had an ABBA dance party in my dorm. I also know basically every Disney song in existence. But I’m trying to expand my horizons and always appreciate any music recommendations!
","I don’t know if this is a possibility, but one of my favorite places to be with people is in the kitchen. I like cooking and particularly baking things like cupcakes or cookies, and I would love to teach or facilitate this. There’s something really special about making food with others. It allows for a really peaceful, focused silence.

I also like impromptu dance parties (I really can’t dance but I love it so much) and singing. One of my favorite parts of my own camp experience was singing songs by the campfire, and I'd love to recreate that.
","Everything I have learned so far about Camp Kesem- the email letters from counselor alumni, the information sessions, the testimonials- has been deeply moving. I remember someone from the Kesem team talking about how there’s such a possibility for real connection in vulnerability, and this is something I’ve personally learned this quarter. I’m learning to be more honest and real with what I’m feeling and thinking, and to give love and kindness without holding back, and I want to continue learning this and practicing this around kids. I love being around kids because they are wonderful, wacky, and incredibly underrated.

I am searching for an authentic, sincere experience, and I want to encounter personal growth in an organic way. I feel like there are tons of opportunities here at Stanford to do incredible things, and I hope to take part in many of them. But what seems so special about Camp Kesem is that nothing about this time commitment is resume fodder. I want to be a camp counselor because I want to do something genuinely, completely for others and not for myself. It’d be a privilege to take part in a community that’s as wonderful as this one seems to be!
","Something I’ve had to come to terms with since starting college has been my Indian identity, and what it means to be Indian-American. Growing up in a small (and pretty homogenous) town meant that I was racially and culturally different. I learned to minimize my identity in lots of different ways- to downplay my “Indian-ness,” go with the Americanized pronunciation of my name, not partake in cultural or religious events and choose not to actively learn about what being Indian means to me.
Coming to Stanford has been, in some ways, a shock. People here are so accepting of cultural diversity. I’ve never been around so many people who knew about and appreciated Indian/South Asian culture. Here, I’ve met Indian people and non-Indian people who know way more about my culture than I do! That’s been surprising, and taught me that this is an important part of myself that I ought to be exploring and understanding. 
Learning about this conflict within myself is teaching me how to bridge the gap, and it’s teaching me to seek out diversity and look it differently. I guess I’m learning that I need to wholly and completely accept all parts of myself in order to accept other people. This has made me even more invested in creating spaces for people to be themselves, to encourage people to ask big questions about themselves and life and the universe and their purpose. I think that’s the only way we will learn to accept ourselves and others.

Dates: July 2017 and 2018
Description: The past two summers, I have worked as a counselor/chaperone on a eighth grade soccer trip to Sweden and Denmark. Every year, my former soccer club, Marin FC, takes approximately 40 girls and 30 eighth grade soccer players to participate in tournaments and cultural exchange in Sweden and Denmark. I have worked on this trip for the past two summers, coaching soccer, chaperoning and leading activities for the players off the field, and staying with them in the classrooms that we lodge in. This job is definitely challenging as these 12 year olds are quite excited to be out of the country, with all of their friends, without their parents, and surrounded by thousands of similarly aged soccer players from around the world. As a result it has taught me great lessons of leadership, effectively managing large numbers of children, navigating emotionally charged, complicated and challenging situations among 12 year olds while always maintaining physical and emotional safety, and forging deep and rewarding connections in the process.

Role: Teacher's assistant, Teacher, Board Member
Dates: January - March 2018
Description: I also spent 3 months of my gap year this past year in rural western Kenya at a primary school called the nambale magnet school. Here, I interacted with kids ranging from age 3 to 13 on a daily basis in the classroom, at study halls, on the soccer pitch and during meals. My responsibilities over these three months included assisting in the classroom as a teacher’s aid, tutoring the students, leading elective classes outside of the national curriculum such as ukulele, creative writing, and public speaking, and coaching soccer. This was truly one of the most impactful and rewarding experiences of my life, and I fully attribute the immense value of this trip to the meaningful relationships I developed with the kids. Over my three months, I grew incredibly close to kids across a spectrum of ages, hearing about their vastly different life stories and upbringings, passions, dreams, and then sharing my own. This experience taught me a lot about how to connect with kids in a very meaningful way, and also the value of such connections, as I now keep in touch with a bunch of these students and

Dates: 2015-17
Description: With two friends similarly passionate about filmmaking, we started our schools film and video club that eventually became the Marin Academy Video Team, our school's official videography team that was responsible for making sports promotions, admissions videos, and any other school videography needs. 

Role: Team Captain Marin Academy Women's Varsity Soccer
Dates: Winter 2017
Description: As the captain of my soccer team, I led team bonding activites such as team dinners, hikes, and outings, and fostered an inclusive environment on our team. Despite not having any all-star players like years prior, my co-captain and I led our team to our most successful season in recent history with a variety of goal scorers. Most importantly, we all had a blast and grew amazingly close!

Role: Member of Peer Resources
Dates: 2015, 2016, 2017
Description: Led lunchtime workshops and communications evening to facilitate difficult discussions surrounding socio-economic status, drug and alcohol culture at our high school, hookup culture and consent, racial segregation at our school, and other taboo but very important topics. ","Back in the summers of 2005, 2006, and 2007, when I was 6, 7, and 8, my family spent a week of our summer out on a family farm called emmendal in Mendocino county. On the ride up, just before arriving at the farm, my dad would let me and my brothers take turns sitting on his lap and controlling the wheel as we drove across this huge open field. I remember giggling a lot, waiting in anticipation for my turn, and listening to the dixie chicks and alan jackson CDs my dad liked to blare. Our time actually at emmandal was always a blast as well - milking cows, picking blackberries, baking farm fresh pies and playing tag in the fields - but getting there was somehow even more memorable. Being packed in our car with my entire family, no one’s mind on anything outside of our suburban and this open field, I remember feeling very connected and joyous.","1. I believe in auras/vibes and I think its a big part of who I am. Every day, I think about how I can bring a good, positive, light energy into the spaces I enter. And it builds on itself. I smile a lot, I laugh often, and I work hard to make my body language and presence put people at ease and empower them to be their best, most liberated, self. 
2. I play the mandolin and love to jam. I’m actually a very mediocre mandolin player (and a very bad guitar and piano player too, but I can make it work), but music has always been something that has brought so much joy into my life. Jamming with someone offers a connection and joyful vulnerability that I haven’t found in any other medium. I’m always down to play, camp Kesem included!
3. One thing I value immensely is gratitude, and I consider it to be a big part of who I am. In my phone notes, I have a big list of things I am grateful for, and I return to these notes often as a form of grounding meditation. Gratitude reminds me what matters and why life is so amazing, and I attribute much of my excitement for life to the simple recognition of what there is to be excited about.  ","I'd love to teach creative writing. When I was in Kenya, I taught a lot of creative writing and found it to be a totally fun and rewarding experience, for both me and the kids. Creative writing is especially perfect to learn at summer camp, outside of the pressures and expectations of school. To me, creative writing is a way to reflect, explore, take risks, and think differently about the things that are important to me, and I would love to lead poetry, short story, and creative non-fiction writing activities to share these things that I so cherish about creative.
","I went to camp for three summers when I was age 8, 9, and 10. My camp experience was under different circumstances, but it was an all girls camp and it was a profoundly positive experience in my childhood. I remember  that within days of arriving at camp, through the activities and community experiences I quickly developed a sense of confidence and joy for who I was and how I fit into this welcoming group of women of all ages. I would leave the summer proud of the things I had done, the friends I had made, and the experiences we had all shared. And it stuck with me even to this day, that grounding sense of home and support.
	I know how special camp is, and how important for growth it can be, and I would love to be a part of such an environment again. I really believe in the value of summer camp, and I know how deep the experience can be. I want to both experience all of that, and contribute to this environment of vulnerability, limitless joy, and support that I was privileged enough to experience in my own childhood. Camp is an amazing thing to experience, and I want to help foster such an experience while (thinking selfishly) getting to enjoy such a special community and state of mind myself.
","As a white, middle class female from San Francisco, I don’t tend to offer a lot of diversity within Stanford affiliated groups and communities. However, living abroad in Kenya and Cuba during my gap year have definitely been unique life experiences, and I really value and enjoy talking about diversity and inclusion, and if I can contribute anything to that conversation, I would say it has been my own struggle with implicit bias and confronting my own privileges/ thinking about the social hierarchies that I might perpetuate and how to resist that.

Two saturdays ago, I spent the morning on the Stanford Farm laying compost and trimming flowers. After a morning of work, the farm leader sent my friends and I on our way with a few different types of flowers (some already dried, some I dried myself). On the way from the farm back to my dorm, I passed the design school, and on a whim I decided to stop by. With my eyes set on the power tools, I hovered outside the graduate school classroom and when a graduate school student left the room with all the equipment, I asked him to hold the door and snuck in (later I got kicked out). All alone in a room packed with a variety of materials and machinery, I set out to make a vase for my new flowers. The design below now sits proudly on my desk. I’m not an engineer or anything like that, but I love to tinker, weave together all the little hobbies and excitements of my life, and act on a whim to create things out of nothing.

I remember being incredibly excited because I was finally getting to sleep in a cabin and use a porta potty the way all my friends had talked about. One day into the camp, the thrill of the porta potty had definitely worn off, but there were so many new activities that kept me busy the whole day. It was only a 3 day long camp, but I remember staying up every night, having a very cliche bonfire under the stars with s’mores. It was such a peaceful time, and the memories made here are such a large part of why I want to be a part of Camp Kesem.         ","The first thing is that my mother has had cancer, so I relate to some of the experiences and emotions campers have had. That’s precisely why I want to be a part of making this week as successful as possible. Additionally, I love planning events. With my own friends, for example, I love planning holiday parties and friendsgivings. I feel that a large part of camp is community, so I would love to be a part of planning activities and fostering a strong sense of community among campers. Lastly, I am a high-energy and outgoing person, and I am excited to use these skills to help campers feel more comfortable during the week.","During the week, I have heard that there is an activity where the entire camp comes together to acknowledge why they are here and share their stories. I would love to be a part of facilitating this by creating an event that makes everyone feel comfortable and gives people the space to process their experiences.","Growing up, much of my family was affected by cancer. My aunt and paternal grandparents all died from different types of cancer. This happened when I was very young, however, so I was shielded from a lot of the messiness of the situation. However, when I turned 14, my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer. While she is thankfully is in remission now, the years through treatment were incredibly exhausting.

Growing up, I regularly went hiking with my family, and we still go on hiking vacations in the mountains together.  I also have a little experience camping.  At my summer camp when I was younger, I went on a few base camping trips and canoeing trips (which require setting up camp in a new location every day).  I absolutely love being out in nature and exploring the natural beauty that I don’t regularly get to experience living in a city.  I also feel that it can be easier to open up in such an environment that seems more relaxing and peaceful, less intimidating.  In terms of working with 15 and 16 year olds, my senior year of high school I was head of the math peer-tutoring program at my school and tutored high school students of all ages.  I also was a supervisor of high school volunteers at a local hospital.  Working with individuals of this age group allows the opportunity to support and to form deep connections with kids closer to my age who I might seem more relatable to.  I would love to be able to share my admiration of the outdoors with this group and encourage those who are in the process of figuring out their identities as they grow closer to adulthood.","Role: Babysitting

Description: I started babysitting my younger sister when I was 10 years old, and then graduated to watching younger cousins.  Now, I have babysat kids from a couple months to 12 years old (and a few times four at a time!).

","I have never worked at a camp, although I did attend a sleepover camp in the Midwest for many years, so I have an understanding of general camp environment/activities and I know a lot of great camp songs!","Experience: Research
Dates: June 2015-August 2015, June 2016-present
Description: I spend the majority of my time outside of class doing research in a bone marrow transplant lab, whose goal is to find a way to prevent graft-versus-host disease, a possibility fatal disease that is a form a rejection, after bone marrow transplantation.  If GVHD was prevented, bone marrow transplantations could become a more viable and promising treatment (and often cure) to individuals with blood cancers or other blood diseases.  My grandmother had a transplant many years ago and it means a lot to me that I am working towards preventing a disease she struggles with daily.  

Organization: East Palo Alto Tennis and Tutoring (to expand on experience mentioned above)
Dates:  April 2018-present
Description: Although I’ve only been involved with EPATT for a couple of months, it’s quickly become one of my favorite activities.  It’s a volunteer program that provides tutoring for elementary-high school students who do not receive sufficient education at their schools and are working towards attending college.  I am in charge of the entire 7th grade, which can sometimes be a handful, but is also incredibly rewarding.  My kids tend to struggle a lot with their schoolwork, so it’s always really exciting when they start to understand the material I’m working on them with. 

Experience: Bone Marrow Transplant Clinic at Stanford Medical Center
Dates: June 2017-present
Description: Aside from my research, I attend bone marrow transplantation outpatient clinic, for patients who are planning to undergo transplantation or who have previously completed the treatment.  It’s been really eye-opening to me (and also really difficult) to see first hand the struggles of the patients with cancer.  
","One of my favorite childhood memories is mountain biking in the hills near my childhood house on weekends with my dad, who I didn’t get to spend a lot of time with during the week because he worked a lot.  I really looked forward to our rides because it was our chance to talk, goof off, and also sing a little.  I also really liked being active with my dad.  I had a bike with only a back tire that we’d hook up onto the back of his bike, which helped him to do most of the work.  While the hills we biked aren’t particularly impressive, for elementary school me (and probably also today’s me), it was really difficult.  But there were a few hills (we called them the double humps) where my effort (also known as struggling) and weak peddling and cheering were necessary to get over them.  Knowing that my dad, who I saw as really strong and capable, needed help from a puny, little kid made me feel empowered and now helps me look back on these memories even more fondly, because I was a central part to the experience that brought my dad and I really close together.  ","This is a little silly, but the first thing I would like to share about myself is that I’m really, really short.  I’ve found that this helps me connect easily with kids, probably because I appear more like a peer or friend because I’m the same size (or smaller), which often translates to feeling like I’m more approachable.  Also, I tend to stay mostly stress-free and relaxed, which reduces worries-especially pertaining to academics- and helps me enjoy my activities more.  My parents and sister always turn to me to help put worries in perspective in order to stress less.  Lastly, I love to sing.  I sing (or hum) almost all the time, and I’ve been slowly working up my confidence to sing in front of more people.  I will sing pretty much anything (regardless of how I feel about the song) and it’s often unconscious because it’s an inherent part of my relaxed state.  ","As a relic from my own summer camp days, I make a lot of friendship bracelets, for my friends and myself.  I am continuing to learn new patterns and improve my knot skills, and would love to teach it as a crafts activity.  It’s a very relaxing process that anyone can do, and provides an environment conducive for talking and getting to know new people.  I would also be interested in singing with the campers, as that has been such an integral part of my entire life.  ","Growing up, I’ve had a lot of interactions with medicine in general.  My dad, grandfather, and other family are all physicians.  A few of them work within the field of oncology.  Based on the stories and experiences they’ve shared with me, my own love of biology, and watching loved ones get sick (my parents’ countless severe bike accidents, my grandmother’s three cancers, a childhood friend’s leukemia, etc), I have wanted to become a doctor for as long as I can remember.  And many of my experiences that stem from this desire have driven me towards Camp Kesem.  I spend countless hours in lab, questioning and struggling (and often failing) but continuing because I want to have an impact in healthcare.  On the more clinical side, I spent all of high school volunteering at a hospital, interacting with patients and family.  And in bone marrow transplant clinic, while the patient is obviously the main focus, the families and friends are an integral part of the experience.  It is really difficult to watch the loved ones in so much pain, feeling so helpless, and there is not enough support for this consequence of disease.  I want to join the community of Kesem in order to help contribute to meeting this need.  Being a child is a particularly vulnerable time; kids dealing with a sick parent while struggling through figuring out their own selves need so much support, and it would be an incredible experience to be a part of that for them.  ","Aside from my multitude of interactions with the field of medicine, one experience that would enable me to connect with the campers comes from high school.  My sophomore year l, my family moved and I had to transfer high schools.  I have always been on the shyer side, and considering that everyone had already found their social groups, I felt really disconnected with my peers.  That isolation was pervasive throughout my entire sophomore year, and I didn’t feel that there was anyone I could turn to in order to discuss my emotional and social struggles.  It was a rough year where I felt really alone.  I didn’t find my “group” until the very end of senior year (a little late!), but coming to Stanford, it was much easier for me to feel included and involved.  While I don’t have to worry about the health of a parent, I can understand the feelings of loneliness and disconnect, thinking that no one understands and that there is no one to share my struggles with, that perhaps many of the campers have.  I never found someone that I trusted to confide in, but I want to be that individual for someone else who needs that support and understanding.  Additionally, while I am not particularly religious, I really value the Jewish idea of mitzvot (good deeds).  When I think of my Jewish culture, I think of the importance of family, of community, of mitzvoth, and to me, Kesem is built from these core values.  ","https://youtu.be/6ZmUBK2uYgs

Sophie was tanking her preliminary interview. I could sense her strong interest in the club, however, and decided to admit her regardless. 
In the fourth grade, I had a series of exciting memories which stemmed from the fact that I organized a contentious superhero ghost-fighting club. It incited controversy among the other fourth graders due to my elaborate and honestly really extra screening process where I sought to determine who among my peers also had “powers.” I had succeeded in persuading myself that I had psychic abilities after a few “tests” with my friends where I was able to read their thoughts. In addition to assembling this team, I determined a number of arbitrary rules and warning signs which indicated the presence of a malevolent spirit, a servant to the paramount nemesis who had opted to target my school. My fellow club members and I would warn each other when we observed such signs (such as a disturbingly high amount of the color green or a “ghostly mark” which ended up being sunscreen) in class by winking at each other. I am certain retrospectively that we were comically obvious about communicating with one another. Despite how ridiculous it sounds, my friends and I would romp around during recess looking for ghosts which gave me a magical sense of escapism and fantasy. ","Firstly, to glean a sense of who I am, know that I value empathy and kindness above all other qualities. The ability to mentally place yourself in another person’s situation facilitates conflict resolution, collaboration, and productivity. People who exercise gratitude and kindheartedness tend to be more grounded and maintain a more optimistic outlook. Thankfully, I believe that empathy is a conscious decision, and that those who lack such capabilities tend to have their own inner turmoil which needs to first be resolved.

Secondly, I want to highlight that camping is an integral part of my identity and has shaped my development. Spending time in nature encourages self-reflection; so much of my time during the school year is spent looking outwards at a screen, textbook, or whiteboard rather than inward to evaluate my state of being. Those nights spent listening to the sound of the crackling fire and the mellow trickle of the river, absorbing the warmth of the glowing embers of pine, and staring upwards into an infinite speckled sky, I cannot help but ponder my role within the universe. There is nowhere to hide from unpleasant thoughts and feelings, no more of the distractions that are pervasive throughout the industrialized world. 

Lastly, know that I laugh often, and often for stupid or seemingly unprecedented reasons. I believe in the importance of preserving a sense of humor throughout hardships. Laughter does not entirely displace or negate pain, but it can at least alleviate despair when one feels hopeless.  ","Over the summer, when I worked at the Ronald McDonald House Sibling Summer Camp, we piloted one activity that ended up being quite popular in which we gave kids spray bottles, sponges, and paints and had them decorate long rolls of paper. The campers delighted in the process of creating vibrant canvases. Some used sponges to create impressions or negative spaces on the paper and others turned the activity into a game where you had to cover a majority of the paper with your assigned color. It’s fun if you don’t mind a little messiness and wear old clothes!","When I first heard about the mission of Camp Kesem, to serve children whose family members have been affected by cancer, I immediately felt an impetus to become involved. Cancer has touched multiple people close to me; it completely uproots a person’s life, erodes at one’s physical strength and psychological spirit, and can even cause severe financial issues for socioeconomically underprivileged individuals. The thought of a vulnerable child observing a loved one endure this devastating disease absolutely breaks my heart. Adolescence already encompasses insecurity, stress, and self-doubt, and adding this additional layer of an ill family member just seems so unfair.
 
With these considerations, I would be incredibly honored to be chosen as a camp counselor and to serve as a mentor and a role model in the lives of these kids, a position in which I have the capacity to facilitate the development of healthy coping strategies, confidence, self-identity, and resilience. I have always enjoyed working with children, whether it be at the Ronald McDonald House where I helped develop and run a summer camp for kids with ill siblings, Larchmont Charter School where I supported students with special educational needs, or the more informal setting of caring for my little brother. Children are so impressionable, and they process loss differently than adults, oftentimes causing behavioral changes to manifest in unpredictable ways. When I succeed in brightening a kid’s day in the midst of a hardship, it means the world to me. ","There needs to be increased socioeconomic diversity among people who explore and enjoy the outdoors. I was raised by a single mother who was very impoverished for a long period of my childhood. Despite our unstable financial status, she looked for affordable and creative outlets to entertain my brother and I. We went on numerous excursions and nature trips, utilizing cheap motels and unorthodox camping sites to make these experiences feasible. These adventures encouraged me to be inquisitive and exploratory from a young age. 

Additionally, I identify as a queer woman and worked extensively to support the LGBTQ community during high school by serving as the Co-President of the Genders and Sexualities Alliance. We held weekly meetings to discuss queer issues such as coming out as transgender, intersectional identities, and the process of coming out. An LGBTQ status can compound the adverse psychological effects of traumas, especially when it coincides with conservative and intolerant family members. Moreover, my leadership in this organization imparted onto me better listening skills and familiarized me with the common obstacles faced by queer youth. I have learned how to consciously create spaces in which people feel safe expressing themselves and exploring their identities.",https://www.dropbox.com/s/xtd21y3la42r64k/photo%20project.pdf?dl=0, (https://hillelatstanford.wufoo.com/cabinet/enlrZWg3azE3amFrMmk=/JsfhuSV0ac4%3D/),Psalm Pineo-Cavanaugh,2/23/99, (https://hillelatstanford.wufoo.com/cabinet/enlrZWg3azE3amFrMmk=/JsfhuSV0ac4%3D/),Psalm Pineo-Cavanaugh,2/23/99,12/6/18 0:55,public,12/6/18 13:42,public,68.65.169.4,6,1

When I began volunteering as the assistant production manager during my sophomore year, I had no experience in any of these areas, but I found myself wholeheartedly learning as much as I could. I was grateful that my position allowed me to contribute to multiple aspects of the production as a whole. Some days would be spent behind a piano rehearsing music parts with the middle schoolers while other days, I would be collaborating with my fellow high schoolers, painting sets or learning about the lights. Through the entire experience, I got to work with people of different ages and positions, including volunteer parents, kindergartners, and especially middle schoolers. I especially became close to those I helped put mics on before performances, dispelling pre-show jitters with easy jokes and positive pep talks. Even after the production had ended, I made an effort to continually check-in with them. To see them shining on-stage and off-stage reminded me why I loved working with students and kept me coming back to volunteer for the next musical production year after year. (194 words)

Although my middle school friends and I went to different high school, we stayed connected through our church’s handbell choir. Handbells are an amazing instrument; the variety of techniques that can be utilized to make music, from ringing to malleting to plucking and everything in between make playing the instrument challenging and fun. However, what kept me coming back to rehearsals was the sense of community amongst the ringers. In a handbell choir, each individual is assigned two bells. Alone, a part sounds disjointed and strange, but together with the entire choir, the music combines in an amazingly beautiful way. This sense of togetherness translated from our music to our interactions. I found myself contributing both in the part I played and in the personality, beliefs, struggles, and joys that I brought to every Sunday rehearsal. Likewise, I was able to benefit from the perspectives of others. We supported each other and celebrated each others’ accomplishments. They taught me how to be a collaborative member, and the lessons that I gained while playing the handbells easily translated to ideas of teamwork in my day-to-day life. Now, even though my friends and I may live across the country from each other, I still feel truly connected to them thanks to the community built during our time together in handbells. (218 words)

While my love for animals and my relationship with my coworkers made the summer camp at the Fort Worth Zoo in Texas a great place to work, it was the kids who make the experience truly worthwhile. Over the course of a week, my fellow teacher assistants and I got to know each of our twenty or so campers individually during walks from exhibit to exhibit or arts and crafts activities in the classroom. One week I may be working with fifth graders while the next may have me caring for preschoolers. Either way, I considered it to be a dream job. Working at the zoo allowed me to bring my enthusiasm for animals and biology to an equally enthusiastic group. Teachers gave a great deal of responsibility to teacher assistants, whether it was leading the class through the zoo or designing educational crafts that matched our vocabulary words for the day. I even remember teaching our second grade class a lesson about the tides and ocean currents. Such tasks required that I utilize creativity and simpler perspective to teach the lessons in an interesting and fun way and be prepared for mishaps so that I could be flexible when they occured. I have never spent my summers in a more fun and fulfilling way, and the truly indescribable memories obtained during my experience at the zoo encourage me to look for more opportunities to work with kids and apply to Camp Kesem.

Being a freshman, I am relatively young, therefore it will be easier for me to connect with freshman and sophomores in high school. OLP focuses a lot on team-building and leadership- skills that I have learned through my many years of playing team sports both in. Another common ground these teens and I may find is, for example, we both had a parent affected by cancer at their age. When I was a sophomore in high school, my mother was diagnosed with cancer. In some cases this may provide a feeling of comfort- knowing someone older can relate and that they can talk about it. 

I do not have any past experience working with this age group or with the outdoors.  
","Role: Volunteer at the Santa Monica High School Infant and Toddler Center

Description: As a volunteer at the infant center on my high school’s campus, I assisted infants with washing hands before meals, sleeping, and reading.

Role: Vice President of the Doctors Without Borders Club at my High School 
Date: October 2016 - October 2017
Description: As a co-founder / vice president of this club, I helped plan all of the fundraisers and bake sales we hosted both inside and  outside of school. All proceeds from these events were donated to the organization via their website. While my impact is quite minimal in the grand scheme of things, it was helpful for the people who were eventually attended by Doctors Without Borders.

","One of my favorite childhood memories however, was a particular trip my family took to Laughlin, Nevada. We had taken many trips to Nevada before, primarily for the promotions my dad received in the mail for free hotel stays. This particular trip however, we ventured 100 miles further, which meant more music to listen to. By the second hour of the trip, we were probably on our third CD and I was loving every minute of it. Music became a big part of my life because of these trips- I was forced to listen to so many different genres for hours at a time so I was destined to start loving it. 

When we arrived, I didn’t enjoy myself as much as I did in the car. But regardless, I walked around the rest of the weekend looking down at my watch, waiting for the days to go by so I could listen to music again for 6 hours. This trip helped me discover my hidden liking of all types of music, a memory I will never forget.  To this day I still groove into each day to music inspired by those same CDs. The I listen to now take me to the roots of the genre, to the city lights, and to the projects––a car merely takes me from Point A to B. Music picks me up when no one else can. It allows me to express myself- something that is unforgettable once discovered.

","I am a very fun and energetic person. On multiple occasions, I have been asked where I get all of my good energy from. I have been like this forever. Even through the toughest of situations, I have always made it out to be a positive experience- no matter how hard it was to do so. I try to make the best out of every situation, and try to uplift others in the process. 

I have a deep love for music. My favorite childhood memories are recalled with different songs- associations that happen spontaneously. I can make a playlist within minutes, and curate a selection of sounds to match situations, genres, and even colors. Listening to music is my way of finding my inner temple, and is how I get through the lowest of days. 

Being from a big city, I didn’t really have access to the woods or to nature. My family didn’t like camping, therefore I never really had the outdoor experience like a lot of others have. Instead, I picked up other outdoor activities to enjoy. These activities were mainly soccer and skateboarding. I picked both of these up at a young age, and through the years have applied the discipline that they taught to daily life. I never gave up on a skate trick or a soccer move, and that has made me a resilient individual. 
","I would be very excited to teach anything related to science/nature as well as facilitate any sport-related activities at Camp Kesem. While my outdoor experience is bare, I would be more than willing to learn more prior to camp in order to successfully teach anything related to the outdoors. 

Outside of nature and science, I would also be excited to facilitate an obstacle course challenge/ competition for pairs of campers. 
","Cancer, like for many, has had a detrimental impact on my life in general. My aunt battled it for over 10 years, my mother’s best friend is still fighting it, and my own mother was defeated by it. When my mother was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, my world was undoubtedly distraught. Seeing my mother, an undeterred woman, be resected within a span of four months with ineffective efforts to fight her aggressor drained me of hope; it left me feeling beaten down at the start of each day and angry with the world. I was consumed by my worries each day, never knowing where the next day would take her. 
	Camp Kesem sounds like a dream for my 16 year-old self. One week away from home, in the woods, and with new people who I would most likely befriend. Having gone through the cycle of cancer and grieving the loss of a loved one, I have a sense of what is felt everyday when you’re reminded of your family’s circumstances. Volunteering my time to Camp Kesem would further advance my own healing, as I would be helping children who can relate to my situation. Being around these kids would be inspiring, and I all I would want is to help someone else through the bumps and bruises of cancer’s invasion into their family. 
","Why isn’t your name Carlos or something?” For years, I have received this questions, each time with a different “Latino” name to fill the blank. As a child, I never once questioned my name or considered the weight of the comments made by my peers. Yet, as a child I did question why my life differed so much from those of my friends’- why their houses were so big, why they had women like my mother cleaning their house. The homes of my friends is where I first encountered stereotypes- and I soon began to see them everywhere.
Years later, I realized that I wasn’t prepared for the realities of a Latino living in the United States. As a first-generation college student, my situation differs a lot from others.  I figured out a lot of life-related issues on my own, especially those related to grief, college, and combating stereotypes. Being so young, we aren’t educated on how to best approach a situation with cancer now in the room. I feel like I can be a good asset to support campers and help them avoid having to navigate through these rough waters alone- especially when cancer isn’t the only thing affecting their families. 
","Spongebob Squarepants- The Campfire Song Song 
The Beatles - Come Together 
Queen- We Will Rock You 
Phoenix- Lisztomania 
 

This is a short selection of songs I found fitting for a camp setting. While short, I feel like they all capture a different goal of camp. The Campfire Song Song captures the image of what the average person thinks of when they see the word camp. Come Together is undoubtedly a classic, and represents the unity that a week together at camp forms. We Will Rock You represents the fun of camp as a whole (and maybe a bit of the competitiveness in certain group activities). Lisztomania is a song that I felt encapsulates all of the good that happens while at camp. It is the background song of the week, and the song you listen to when you want to recall all that you did at camp.

I am also in the process of becoming a trip leader for the Stanford outdoors program and hope to lead trips as soon as this spring. I love the outdoors so much because it is a place with total freedom and allows people to grow into themselves, which is why I’m so attracted to the leadership aspect of OLP. I think that leadership is developed by understanding one’s self better and I see no better way to have this type of reflection than in the outdoors. I hope to teach the leadership skills I have learned over the years with the kids in the OLP program. Not only is it enjoyable to teach leadership in the outdoors, but it is also very rewarding to see the growth that can happen in a time span as short as a week.","Role: Babysitter in my local neighborhood
Dates: Summers of 2012-2014 (8th through 10th grade)
Description: Watched over the kids of a few families in my neighborhood while their parents were working. The kids were anywhere from 1st to 6th grade and the families had 2-4 kids. I brought them to the park, played games with them in their houses/backyards, made them lunch, and put them to bed.

Role: Lifeguard
Dates: June 2015 - August 2016 (Summers of 11th and 12th grade)
Description: On top of regular lifeguard duties at my community’s local pool, I often had to work with little kids who stubbed their toes, got lost from their parents, didn’t quite know what the deep end was, and even those who wandered to the back of the lifeguard’s break room. There were also hockey camps throughout the summer and strongly encouraging a bunch of rambunctious teenage boys to behave on the pool obstacle course and slides were a big part of my job.

Description: I was in charge of helping to develop a curriculum for a student led class about american space policy in the Spring of 2018. This included finding readings and deciding on material to cover for the students, reaching out to and organizing speakers for the class from both the private and public space industries, and leading lectures for the class.

Role: Co-Founder of Political Startup
Dates: March 2018 - Present
Description: I helped build up and work on a political startup that aims to better connect constituents with their elected representatives. I was in charge of finding ways to understand political polarization and spent a large part of my summer by talking to over 2000 people online, in person, and over the phone. I gathered this information and tried to build a product that would allow people to better understand and have political discussions with those whose they disagreed with on the other side of the political aisle. ","The silver can was just sitting there, begging me to run towards it. My older cousin Tommy, who was supposed to be guarding it had left it unwatched for a few seconds as he went to check behind a tree 15 feet away from me for another one of us trying to steal the can from him. Bad choice. I was behind a different tree to his left and took my chance right when he ducked his head around the other tree’s trunk. I ditched my spot of solace and ran as fast as my 9 year old legs would take me towards the can. Victory was imminent, I could taste in the air rushing past my face. Just as I was reaching out my leg to kick the can off its pedestal and win the game, I felt a strong arm tag my shoulder and push me off course, keeping the can from its savior. Tommy’s face lit up with the realization that he only had to protect the can from two more of his cousins, as I meandered my way to the sidelines. It didn’t take long for him to lure my other cousin and sister to his victory. Again. It was no fair that he was 12, but a challenge we younger cousins enjoyed. After the game we made our way to the pool up the hill attached to our grandparents house in South Dakota for a quick swim before the sun set.","The most important thing you should know about me is that I don't take myself too seriously. In middle and high school, I would spend too much time and energy avoiding situations I thought would embarrass me and was self conscious about what people thought about me. What I came to realize is that life is embarrassing no matter which way you turn! I learned to embrace the moments that flushed my face and knotted my stomach and slowly but surely learned to laugh at myself and embarrassing situations. Anyways, it’s way more fun to be silly instead of serious. On a similar note, I like to live my life with a smile on my face and a laugh not too far behind it. “Smile and wave” is not only one of my life mottos but also one of my favorite movie quotes (from the penguins in Madagascar). While there are definitely times in my life when this motto does not apply to the way I am feeling, I believe that when you are happy, it is very important to recognize and celebrate it by sharing happiness with others and this quote reminds me to do so. Finally, my next big goal in life is to learn how to dance (well). I’m really not great at dancing but admire great dancers a lot, and am inspired everytime I go to the quarterly dance show at Dink. So logically, it is my next big personal endeavor!","Writing poetry! I picture my thoughts as a pile of wet clothes and my mind as the washing machine that spins those clothes endlessly. I’ve found that writing my thoughts down onto paper is equivalent to taking the wet clothes out of the washer so I can better think through whatever is on my mind. Poetry specifically is something I’ve grown to love recently and find it super fun to do, to teach, and easy to learn. It gives the writer the creative freedom to express their thoughts in any way they desire and is therapeutic in the process.","I want to be a counselor at Camp Kesem because I want to help guide kids as they learn to cope with loss and share how I have learned to cope with my own personal experience with grief. Prior to my time at Stanford, grief and death played a major role in my life. In the four years I was in high school, 14 people from my community passed away including two close friends and two parents of close friends. While many of these deaths were sudden and unexpected, I learned how I process death on my own but also learned to help other grieve. I have been on both sides of the process and know how different each individual deals with it. Secondly, camp was one of my favorite places to go as a kid and was something I looked forward to every summer. I never had the opportunity to become a counselor, sadly, and see Kesem as the perfect way to fulfill this adolescent dream mine. Camp, to me, is a place of freedom and exploration and gave me a week away from my parents and societal norms. It is a place where being goofy and free spirited is the norm and I hope that as a counselor I embody and further these ideas and norms that regardless of your age, life experience, or anything in between, there is a place where you can be free to express yourself in anyway you derive the most enjoyment from.","Before coming to Stanford, I prepared myself for a lot of things from the rigor of academics to living 2000 miles away from home. But, something I was not prepared for and shocked me for the first time was socioeconomic status. I come from a middle class family and went to an underfunded public school in Minnesota. About 50% of my classmates were non-white and more than 50% were on the Free and Reduced Lunch program. I was very used to a range of ethnic, socio-economic, and cultural backgrounds and when I arrived to Stanford I thought this would stay the same. Yet, I was wholly unaware of the mammoth amounts of wealth some of my peers were so accustomed to. However, it was not the money itself that struck a chord within me, but the second thought regarding money that surrounded me for the first time in my life. Money consciousness is still something that actively runs through my mind and that I do not feel is talked about very often at Stanford. I am very open about feeling uncomfortable on the basis of socio-economics at Stanford and the insanely irregular wealth from the silicon valley area. I think that my experience and willingness to discuss socio-economics will enable me to support campers who come from lower and middle class families and I hope to make them more comfortable if they see a counselor from the same kind of home life as them!","Purpose

You know when you’re peeing in the middle of the night,
eyes half open, the groggy fog from your dreams still obscuring
your conscious thoughts on your way back to your room when
your big toe finds something sharp in the darkness and you scream

Wait, how did I end up here, surrounded by palm trees that drip
golden light onto the burned burgundy bricks set in perfect order, begging
your feet to walk with them when suddenly you look up and a bike
is hurtling at you out of nowhere like the asteroid to end all human civilization
is hurtling at the Earth and your heart drops out of your

Chest is bare, since clothes are not needed where the sky is free
from buildings that didn’t ask permission to scrape its underbelly,
where the crying wind permeates your soul, just like the person you love
who makes the monarchs flying south to Mexico for the winter all get lost
at the same time in your stomach until you blink and, in that momentary pause,
realize your hands are sweating profusely so you wipe them on

Some of the best memories I have come from such camping trips where we're cooking dinner in the rain or sitting around a campfire eating our dessert after a long day. Be it hiking or stargazing, the outdoors has always brought me joy and has always been an incredible way to bond with the people around me. It is a chance to forget what is happening in the outside world and live in the moment, focusing on the people you are with. ","Role: RCC
Organization: Rinconada Dorm
Dates 2018-Present
I am currently a staff member at an all frosh dorm. The experience has been very fulfilling and has me grow in my role of supporting other in times of needs. It has prepared me to support kids that are feeling isolated or confused about their goals. 

Role: Founding Member and Treasurer

Role: Senior Instructor
Organization: Taekwondo Martial Arts
Dates: 2012-2016 (Grades 9-12)	
Currently a third degree black belt, I have been involved with Taekwondo since 2003. I started volunteering to teach classes of 40-50 students between the ages of 6-40 in 2012. The majority of students were in middle school. I taught them self defense techniques and proper form/technique for movements.

Role: Assistant Scoutmaster and previously Senior Patrol Leader
Organization: Boy Scouts
Dates: 2012-Present	
Achieved Eagle Scout and am still currently involved with my troop. I mentor and teach younger scouts life and survival skills. Currently, the troop mostly consists of 6-9th grade students.

Role: Youth Leader
Organization: Balagokulam
Dates: 2012-2016 (Grades 9-12)
Taught younger children about religious values and history. Kids’ ages ranged from 4-10 years old. I also organized team building activities and games for every meeting.","I worked at a week long summer camp for boy scouts where students were organized by troop. There were various activities students could choose to attend throughout the day from activities like swimming, hiking, sailing, and first aid. I taught merit badge activities dealing with understanding reptiles and mammals. I was also in charge of dining hall etiquette and clean up during parts of the camp. Here, I placed students into rotations who would wipe down the tables, stack chairs, and clear out dining hall for other activities. I also helped plan skits and organize an IM League for various sports such as ultimate frisbee within the camp. ","Circle of Friends and staffing has been some of the most meaningful groups in my life.  

I am very proud of the impact I was able to have in Circle of Friends. In high school, I noticed many special education kids were isolated in the cafeteria and kept to themselves. So, my friends and I started to sit with different special education students, they started laughing, opening up about their favorite movies, and what they were doing over the weekend. Each time I came, they were wide-eyed and ready to give me a hug. I realized my peers had many preconceived notions about the kids. However, if they had an opportunity to talk to some of the kids, I was sure they would come to appreciate the kids’ company as I have. Thus, I started Circle of Friends. Setting up a lunch buddy system, my peers had a chance to finally meet them. In a few years, there was more demand, over 200 students, then there were kids meaning people had to double or even triple up for lunch. Leaving high school, I was happy to see that these kids were not sitting alone but now spread throughout the cafeteria talking to many students. Students even helped create and setup a district wide special olympics and a valentine’s day dance. Whenever I visit the school, I’m glad to see that the new students continue to foster the same openness as they continue to bring the kids into their own friends circles.  

Staffing a Freshman Dorm has also been extremely meaningful to me. It is a privilege to staff and guide the kids in my dorm. They come to me with questions about stress, love, friendships, isolation, self doubt, and confusion. Honestly, it was extremely daunting at first. I did not have the perfect answer to all of their questions. I soon realized it was more about listening than providing them with a concrete solution. I am there for the kids as someone they can talk through issues, their day, or even their dreams. Having the ability to create activities such as getting grants for the kids to go general admission to a concert or a spa day after a stressful week has been extremely fulfilling. Seeing the kids happy brings me happiness as well, and I cannot wait to see what new memories we create in the next two quarters.","On of my favorite childhood memories is a family trip to Atlanta. This was a week or so after my Dad had gotten my brother and I Heelys! We went to the Coca-Cola factory and made sure to taste every single Coke drink possible probably over 150 combinations. After each one, we would all give a rating and it was fun to see my Mom’s face squirm after tasting the Beverley while my brother’s face light up with delight. Honestly, I mostly remember their faces as it went from different combinations of smiles to frowns. This was a time where my parents had no emails to worry about and my brother and I were not old enough to be distracted by phones. We just had each other. We were all the entertainment we needed. For the rest of trip, my brother and I couldn't stop playing with our heelys. My dad and mom just smiled as we would wheel through the park. We just drove around to different spots until my brother and I were tired. Finally, my mom brought out yesterday’s dinner leftovers in ziploc bags and we all ate in the trunk of our car watching the sun set.","For one, I love to paint, draw, or sculpt. I have always seen art as a way to express myself and a way to hone my skills. As a kid, I attended art camps for several summers. I loved to be able to look at a block of wood or piece paper and visualize how it might end up. I can still remember the smell of sawdust in the air and glistening tools on the table form sculpting. Moreover, I have an unbridled curiosity and imagination that fuel my dreams. I remember looking at a room in my house and imagining turning it into a fort. I would persevere until I turned my dreams into reality. Over the next couple hours, I would transform the room and the room would be covered with blankets from the ceiling and sea of pillows underneath to lay on.  I hope I'm always curious and not afraid to play/have fun in life, because I want to be doing things that I enjoy doing and brings me happiness. ","I would love to teach hip hop dance. To me, dance is not just a series of successive movements. It is a way to express emotions and a way to connect with others. I would love to share this appreciation with the kids. The kids would not have to have any experience in dance. I want to provide them a space where they can dance to their heart's content judgement free. It would be my privilege to show them certain moves or even choreograph a dance to perform at the end of the week. ","I wouldn't be the person I am today without the countless people that have helped me along the way be it teachers, friends, counselors, or RAs. It would be a privilege to give back in the same way that others have given to me. These kids have gone through so much. I would love to make them smile, fingerpaint with them, or teach them how to dance. It is hard to go through something so painful at such a young age, and I want to genuinely be there for them in whatever way I can. If they need a shoulder to lean on and someone to talk to or just a place to let loose and not worry, I will be there.",,"I love birds and have always envied their ability to fly. I also love the outdoors especially at night.

","As a child, my parents wanted my little brother and I to have the opportunity to experience all the amusement parks and different attractions near where we lived. So, every year my parents bought annual passes for the family to one park/attraction, and every year we would change the park/attraction. Therefore, my brother and I got to experience and enjoy each location for a year, and then move on to the next. Because of my parents, I have been to Disneyland, Universal Studios Hollywood, Seaworld, Legoland, different zoos, Knotts Berry Farm, Soak City, and so much more as a child!
","1. I like to have a schedule and a consistent lifestyle. That means sleeping and waking up at the same time every day. Plus, I like to wake up early because I do not like feeling that I have wasted the day by sleeping in (hence, I try to have all morning classes). 

2. I was one of four Sunny Hills High School Representatives chosen for their proven and potential leadership abilities to attend an intensive three-day training/experiential program as part of the Rotary Youth Leadership Awards (RYLA) Camp. 

3. Throughout high school, I conducted research in bladder cancer. Thus, I am greatly aware and informed of the implications of cancer on patients and their families. 
","I would love to include and teach the children about the science behind all of their activities. For example, when they go canoeing, why is it that their canoe can stay afloat? Or, when they do the small art and craft activities like making slime -- how is made and why. 
","As I was once a camper with camp counselors, they created an environment where my fellow campers and I grew to form the most unique and wonderful friendships I could ever have. Camp also filled me with learning life’s most important lessons, but only with the guidance from counselors. As a camper, I gained confidence and faced my fears, which built a self-worth unlike any other. The day I got home from camp, my dad asked me how it was and I found myself at a loss for words. The experience was truly so remarkable and breathtaking that instead of saying anything to my dad, I couldn’t help it and just bursted into tears. It was an experience like no other, and I want to be able to provide that to kids of the next generation. After going through camp first hand, I see the effects of the counselors’ hard work and dedication to changing children’s lives (as it did mine) and I wish to give that to every child out there. Especially kids who are dealing with or have dealt with parents who have or had cancer, they need this reassuring moment in their life, knowing that there is goodness and hope. 
","Threats were a side effect of my high school classmates’ and my upbringing and the academic culture that had brainwashed us into thinking education is “survival of the fittest”. Instead of focusing on what I had to do, I walked into every class each day feeling threatened by someone else’s success. I had a wall of post-it notes with messages such as “You are NOT the best. You HAVE to be better.” Instead of motivating myself to be my best, I compared myself with everyone else and felt hopelessly useless. 

Competition was a problem that I was resigned to accept, as I saw no other solution. That was until the Rotary Youth Leadership Awards Camp. During the three days we were there, we were pushed to our limits. In the tightrope walking obstacle course, we had to get across using only ourselves and each other; nothing extra was given. After countless attempts, we succeeded as we clung to one another’s bodies and moved as one. At the end of my trip, I drove home with the words, “Rising leaders stand together” printed on my shirt and as my new mindset. 

When I eliminated my competitiveness toward my peers within school walls, I experienced true cooperation, a rise in our self-esteems, and deeper connection with students, rather than the hurtful environment of “me versus them”. Through this experience, I was able to do what I was too afraid to do before: speak up, contribute, and lead. 
","Humble and Grumble were identical twins,
And Humble was ever so meek;
Grumble did nothing but grumble all day,
Some may even call him a freak.

Humble was happy and everyone's friend,
Grumble was jealous of course;
Humble was happy to follow the Lord,
But Grumble, an immoral source.

Humble was never seen wearing a frown, 
And Grumble, ne'er seen with a smile;
Humble won friends by just being himself,
But, Grumble, he won them by guile.

So Grumble, please follow Humble, your twin,
And Humble, don't grumble, I pray,
For grumble will make you like Grumble, your twin, 
Please Grumble, be humble today.

","Growing up my mother was the stereotypical “soccer mom.” Because of this, we recently discovered hundreds of hours of home videos. Around 90 percent of this is tapes of my sister and me putting on a show that we had rehearsed all day. We would wear costumes, sing, dance, act, and eat for the audience. Although many of my memories of what we performed have been replaced by the videos, I still remember how content and appreciated I felt. 
As I near the end of my teenage years, watching these performances is extremely painful. I wonder how my parents had the patience to grant us their full attention after a stressful day of work. This has made me realize how precious the life of a child is and how our actions as adults influences the youth around us. 
","
I am very committed to social justice and civil rights.

I love both serving as group leader and working in groups.

I have an identical twin sister here at Stanford. Being a twin has shaped who I am and taught me many lessons about relationships. After having almost the exact same life as another person for the last nineteen years, I am very good at compromising and sharing. 
","I can easily adapt and learn how facilitate any activity. I love the outdoors and spent most of my summers growing up swimming in some body of water. I have some experience with ropes courses and crafts. I do not have any reservations about making a fool of myself, and I enjoy singing and dancing. Also, I love photography, videography and editing. 
","After transitioning to college, finding ways to incorporate public service into my life has been difficult. Camp Kesem sounds like an amazing way to meet a group of people who are also passionate about giving back to those who face challenges. After talking to many upperclassmen about Kesem, I am fully convinced that being a counselor would provide me with an overwhelming sense of purpose. After a stressful freshman year and before beginning a summer intership or program, this week would allow me to refocus my life on what life is really about. Our daily stresses are irrelevant compared to the power we have to make a difference in the lives of others. ","I believe my life experiences have shaped me into a person who fully understands the necessity of diversity and inclusion of all. 

First, I attended an inner-city public high school with tremendous diversity and, as a result, I am very sensitive to race issues.  

Second, as a political progressive, I was in a tiny political minority at my high school and I experienced discrimination and disapproval on a daily basis.  My role as editor of the newspaper allowed me to speak out on political issues.

Third, I had a profound experience as a counselor at Camp Aldersgate that taught me the importance of inclusivity at summer camp. When I was assigned to the oldest girls’ cabin for oncology week, one camper asked to be called by their transgender name rather than birth name. The camp leaders instructed us to call campers by their preferred names. I believe people should live how they want to live, so I encouraged this camper to embrace his authentic self. As the week went on, this camper became more comfortable at camp. 

On the last day of camp, the camper opened up to me and shared his future goals of becoming a camp counselor and later a gender therapist to provide support he wished he had received. In today’s world flooded with controversy and political turmoil, I was filled with hope that the future will be more inclusive by the overwhelming acceptance of this camper by the other campers.","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQjYoNor9HY

",,"Musical theater is a collaboration of multiple disciplines ranging from sets and lights to music and acting. When I began volunteering as the assistant production manager during my sophomore year, I had no experience in any of these areas, but I found myself wholeheartedly learning as much as I could. I was grateful that my position allowed me to contribute to multiple aspects of the production as a whole. Some days would be spent behind a piano rehearsing music parts with the middle schoolers while other days, I would collaborate with my fellow high schoolers, painting sets or learning about the lights. Through the entire experience, I got to work with people of different ages and positions, including parents, kindergartners, and middle schoolers. I especially became close to those middle schoolers who I helped put mics on before performances when I dispelled their pre-show jitters with easy jokes and positive pep talks. Even after the production had ended, I made an effort to continually check-in with them. To see them shining on-stage and off-stage reminded me why I loved working with students and kept me coming back to volunteer for the next musical production year after year.

Although my middle school friends and I went to different high school, we stayed connected through our church’s handbell choir. Handbells are an amazing instrument; the variety of techniques that can be utilized to make music, from ringing to malleting to plucking and everything in between make playing the instrument challenging and fun. However, what kept me coming back to rehearsals was the sense of community amongst the ringers. In a handbell choir, each individual is assigned two bells. Alone, a part sounds disjointed and strange, but together with the entire choir, the music combines in an amazingly beautiful way. This sense of togetherness translated from our music to our interactions. I found myself contributing both in the part I played and in the personality, beliefs, struggles, and joys that I brought to every Sunday rehearsal. Likewise, I was able to benefit from the perspectives of others. We supported each other and celebrated each others’ accomplishments. They taught me how to be a collaborative member, and the lessons that I gained while playing the handbells easily translated to ideas of teamwork in my day-to-day life. Now, even though my friends and I may live across the country from each other, I still feel truly connected to them thanks to the community built during our time together in handbells.

While my love for animals and my relationship with my coworkers made the summer camp at the Fort Worth Zoo in Texas a great place to work, it was the kids who made the experience truly worthwhile. Over the course of a week, my fellow teacher assistants and I got to know each of our twenty or so campers individually during walks from exhibit to exhibit or arts and crafts activities in the classroom. One week I may be working with fifth graders while the next may have me caring for preschoolers. Either way, I considered it to be a dream job. Working at the zoo allowed me to bring my enthusiasm for animals and biology to an equally enthusiastic group. Teachers gave a lot of responsibility to teacher assistants, whether it was leading the class through the zoo or designing educational crafts that matched our vocabulary words for the day. I even remember teaching our second grade class a lesson about the tides and ocean currents. Such tasks required that I utilize creativity to teach the lessons in an interesting way and be prepared for mishaps so that I could be flexible when they occured. I have never spent my summers in a more fun and fulfilling way, and the truly indescribable memories obtained during my experience at the zoo encourage me to look for more opportunities to work with kids and apply to Camp Kesem.
","Any sort of snow in Texas was a cause for celebration. On winter days when school was canceled, my siblings and I excitedly scarfed down our breakfast before running outside, our pajamas covered with “warm” coats and rain boots. I remember one instance when we decided to create a family of snowmen with one snowman representing each family member. At first, working together as a team, we meticulously rolled out perfect snowballs and dug under muddy powder to find sticks for arms and rocks for noses and eyes. However, after realizing that eight snowmen was a lot for five kids to do in one day, we abandoned the three and a half that we had already made and opted to start rolling a massive snowball. My two remaining siblings and I (the other two had opted to trade soggy gloves and hats for warm pajamas) pushed our snowball back and forth across the lawn, collecting every piece of snow that we could. I remember falling on the ground multiple times giggling so hard when we couldn’t push it any further. We were determined, however, to make the snowball even bigger, so we handpacked snow ourselves. It was so massive that, despite the warm Texas weather, it didn’t melt completely until May. Although the snowball may be long gone, the memories that I associate with it are made to last a lifetime.","1. My family and I love to go on roadtrips from Texas all over the United States. Additionally, my family and I travel abroad. We most frequently visit the Philippines to spend quality time with family there. The perspectives that I gain on these trips allow me to better understand other cultures and appreciate their traditions and my own even more, which I believe will be vital in understanding the various backgrounds of Kesem campers. 

2. Being organized has allowed me to stay on top of my work and other activities while making sure to prioritize family and friends. It is a skill that has developed over the years, especially in extracurricular activities such as Ronald McDonald House and middle school musical productions in which I coordinated team efforts and helped plan events. I hope to bring the knowledge gained from these past experiences as well as my enthusiasm for color-coding to Kesem activities.

3. Making music allows me to express the artistic side of by personality by singing in choirs or playing piano in my dorm. Additionally, I have found that the shared language of music has allowed me to connect with new people and form deep relationships. For example, I got to know my two closest friends here at Stanford by harmonizing and dancing to Panic at the Disco or Adele songs in our dorm’s lounge. Thanks to these past experiences, I know that my musical love will help me connect with campers and counselors alike.","As a senior, I created demonstrations with my chemistry teacher for families visiting the museum. The first allowed guests to add a strip of metal to vinegar and notice how pH changed via a color indicator. We emphasized the effects of carbon dioxide by blowing bubbles into water, making the solution slightly acidic. The second explained cave formations by mixing solutions with carbonate. Replicating these demonstrations and interactive activities would be a way for me to bring my passion and knowledge of chemistry to Camp Kesem and help students better understand important and relevant scientific topics in a safe way. ","No one has shaped my identity more than my four younger siblings. Growing up in a large family, I quickly learned the value of humbleness, positivity, and silliness. From them I learned how to be a cooperative leader, a supportive friend, and the best version of myself because I found fulfillment in being their older sister and sometimes even their second mom. This led me to realize how much I love working with kids. As the eldest, I felt myself growing up quicker than most, but the ten-year age difference between me and my youngest sibling insured that I retained a level of childhood playfulness in my outlook of life. When around kids, I found myself relating to their perspective and laughing at their antics. However, not every day was the best day. Many times, I found myself comforting my campers, students, and siblings during difficult times. I found purpose in helping them through their struggles by trying to bring positivity to the situation and emboldening them by reminding them of their strength. This mission led me to want to be a pediatrician and is why I want to make an impact on the campers at Camp Kesem by striving to create an environment where kids can be carefree without the burden of cancer. At Camp Kesem, I can bring my interests in science, art, music, organization, and leadership as well as my own experiences with health and family to a place where values of community and goofiness are emphasized.","Dinners at home are always a combination of the Filipino and American dishes my family loves, whether it is lechon and green beans or chicken fingers and white rice. The mixed combination of dishes also represents my identity as the daughter of Filipinos who raised their family in the States. Much of my Filipino culture is practiced at home where we eat rice with every meal and learn the values of respect for our elders and commitment to family. Thus, it is a constant struggle to bring my Filipino values into my American lifestyle. Moving away from home in college prompted me to find new ways to express my Filipino-American culture for myself. While I am still learning to blend my two backgrounds, I have come to realize that I can still express my identity, whether it is in the mixture of foods I eat or the lessons from my Filipino upbringing that remind me to respect my teachers and my peers. By being myself, I am sharing my cultures and the unique mix that manifests itself in who I am. I believe that this is an important perspective that I can bring to Camp Kesem because my experiences will help me guide campers to be comfortable with who they are and create safe spaces for them to express their true selves.","For this part of the application, I decided to draw on my interest for graphic design! After watching through Camp Kesem videos, I found that many of the campers' quotes really stuck with me. Based off of Camp Kesem's encouragement of kids to be creative, I designed a poster with the campers' quotes as the main focus. It really embodies what Kesem means to me!

Description: Taught introductory foil classes to new fencers, mainly youth 10-16 years old. Two 2-hour classes per week. Fencing has a steep learning curve, and it was a bit concerning standing across from kids with swords, but coaching for almost two years massively developed my patience (most kids envision swashbuckling/dueling or lightsaber battles to be fencing initially), crisis control/problem-solving (creating a safe/injury-free environment conducive to structured learning for 10-15 kids eagerly holding swords was difficult at first), and interpersonal communication skills (cohesively explaining/demonstrating the same technique to an 8 year old and an 18 year old are quite different).

3. Administrative Intern at Peace Corps Skopje, Macedonia

Description: Coordinated/organized the arrival of a new group of volunteers alongside a Peace Corps staff member, facilitating the volunteers' transition to the country. Shadowed local Peace Corps employees and Peace Corps volunteers in the city (Skopje). While the bulk of my impact here was smoothing the arrival of the MAK-21 volunteer group, this internship gave me an intimate view of a different culture and defined my career goals (work for the US State Department or an NGO!). ","Recess. 

The favorite word of any third grader. 

At my school, recess began promptly after lunch at 11:30 am and ended daily (to my dismay) a short 30 minutes later. As students charged toward the playground once the bell sounded, I headed the opposite direction... to the library. 

While I enjoyed playing tag and basketball with my friends, I found solace in the calm and quiet environment of the library after being surrounded by the chaotic, fast-paced energy of third graders. Spending the majority of my recesses there, I became friends with the school librarian, Mrs. Cecala. 

When not reading the (best kids book series of all-time) Magic Tree House or Roald Dahl, I had fun checking-in returned books and finding their ""homes"" on the shelf using the Dewey Decimal System. (At 8 years old, the Dewey Decimal System was revolutionary and I likened it to ""The Holy Grail of Sorting Things)

Spending time in the library gave me a place to reflect, relax. and read during busy, exciting days of school. Since then, I enjoy being at libraries (not doing work) and simply reading. ","1. I really, really, really like being around kids (even babies)! I love being surrounded by so much energy and speaking with kids about practically anything.

2. I am a Star Wars nerd*. 
(*sentence typed while wrapped in a Star Wars blanket*)

3. I'm always listening to music (and sometimes drawing, painting, or baking as well!) I like pretty much all genres except country (anything from Shostakovitch and Nat King Cole to The Eagles and Rex Orange County). ","I would enjoy facilitating any arts and crafts activities. I've found paint nights and creating art in groups fosters a sense of community in a low-pressure environment, and I would love to help kids feel included in the CK family through being messy, having fun, and making some art!","Camp Kesem distinguishes itself to me in two ways. First, its chief goal is to support a largely underserved community. Children particularly need support in times of hardship, and Kesem aims to provide a community to children that need it. Second, and most importantly, Kesem focuses on the long-term. Rather than simply a temporary, one-week camp, Camp Kesem fosters sustainable, long-term support and builds a community over the years. Campers can connect with their counselors and CK family during the year and over the span of many years.

The long-term nature of the program, combined with the passion of current counselors, reflects to me CK truly seeks to support campers and provide a empathetic community they can always come back to. As such, I would happily volunteer my time to help welcome campers into this family. ","While not directly impacted by a parent with cancer, my younger cousin experienced a similar medical hardship in his family when he was 8. Throughout the years, at family reunions, I've seen it take its toll on him and change him from spirited and talkative kid to an extremely reserved and soft-spoken kid. From this, I'm particularly motivated to support children experiencing hardship as I was unable to do the same for my cousin.

Furthermore, I identify as a biracial (Swiss-Vietnamese) and queer female. My experiences associated with these identities would allow me not only to better support campers in discussions about race and sexuality, but in broader ones relating to tolerance, respect, diversity, and community. 

Finally, I am the oldest of 3 girls from a household with distant/disconnected parents. Hopefully my experiences can help me embrace campers that have struggled with their role in their family.","http://bit.ly/KesemTree

Three-year-old me propped my grandma’s cane sideways as a microphone for my off-tune rendition of “Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star.” My number-one fan attempted to stand on his chubby legs, shouting excitedly in support of his big sister. In that moment, nothing could stop me from believing that I was the best singer in the whole world: with fans, a mic, and a camera, what more would I need?

Though I have loved singing for as long as I can remember, I haven’t always been confident about my voice. The one talent that I wished desperately to have was often, in my eyes, out of my reach, restricted by my average voice, by my narrow range. Constantly comparing myself to others, I was not good enough for myself. 

It was only when I realized all it took to be a good singer was to sing with my heart that I regained faith in my voice. Sometimes, when I feel especially insecure about my own singing abilities, I just need to be reminded of the three-year-old me who did not care what others thought and who sang only because she loved to sing!
","I revel in all the little things that surround me -- from admiring the beauty of dappled light dancing across the pavement to getting lost in my thoughts as I gaze up at the stars.

I’m a pretty sentimental person – the kind who loves mushy melodramas, makes cards for loved ones for every possible occasion, and admires the sunset every day.

I am always ready to simply listen, to be a comforting presence, to provide emotional support to anyone in times of need. Everyone has a story to share, and I would be honored to be able to learn about the different walks of life that ultimately bring us all together! 
","Mini explosions popped in the air as students dropped Alka-Seltzer tablets into film canisters. “Again! Again!” they shouted while giggling. How could I say no to that? 

My days volunteering at Girls to Women transpired like that. I planned dynamic science activities each week, walking the children through the lessons. From creating lava lamps to extracting DNA from strawberries, the students were able to learn scientific concepts through hands-on experimentation. 

I’d love to bring similar science activities to Camp Kesem, helping campers develop the confidence to not only explore science, but to also tackle any problem that comes their way! 
","Whether I’m volunteering at Ronald McDonald House or teaching science at Girls to Women, when I’m able to make children smile, I feel the most fulfilled with a sense of purpose and excitement, and it is why Camp Kesem, which places great value in simply allowing kids to be kids, deeply resonates with me. 

“Let that lonely feeling wash away; maybe there’s a reason to believe you’ll be okay; ‘cause when you don’t feel strong enough to stand; you can reach, reach out your hand,” Ben Platt sings in the musical Dear Evan Hansen. As a Camp Kesem counselor, I hope to extend my own hand to the campers, to ensure that their voices are heard. As a Camp Kesem counselor, I hope to help these campers know that it is alright to be emotionally vulnerable, to show them that I care about each and every one of their stories and that I hope to understand them from the very bottom of my heart. The children participating in Camp Kesem are forced to grow up quickly, forced to face trying situations. However, Camp Kesem gives them the space to share their feelings with others who know what they are going through, while at the same time nurturing the energy, the excitement, and the sense of wonder that comes with being a child. It’d be an honor to be part of a community so interconnected by empathy, to be a part of the magic that is Camp Kesem!

By spring quarter, I became SOOP’s Membership Coordinator and helped organize and lead my first OC trip. I have continued to stay involved and have served as SOOP’s president since last spring. Our mission is to enhance interpersonal relationships, foster community, and instill personal confidence in Bay Area youth through facilitated outdoor experiences. We work with local high schools to organize hiking, camping, and indoor climbing trips with students ages 14-18 who would not otherwise have access to those activities. My experience has pushed me to contemplate the lack of diversity in the outdoors and what best practices are for enhancing diversity. SOOP’s approach has been to impose as little “outdoorsy” stereotypes as possible and instead listen to how our students want to experience outdoor spaces and then attempt to incorporate as much of their culture as possible. For example, we recently have worked with the OC to change the food for our trips to what our students are used to so that they feel more comfortable and can see themselves as part of the experience rather than just a visitor in a strange world. Through OLP I would continue to share appreciation and skills for the outdoors, improve my own skills of communication and teaching, and learn from younger students through the week of Kesem.

","One of my favorite childhood memories is sitting around a campfire that our counselors made from wood we had gathered from the island we had canoed to. We had cooked dinner, made s’mores, and gone for a twilight swim, and as the last bits of daylight were sliding behind the mountains, we played a game of “Whip Around.” One of our counselors would ask a question and then we would go around the circle and everyone would answer. The questions started out lighthearted (i.e. camp crush) but became more personal as we continued. Our counselors created an environment where everyone felt comfortable being vulnerable and sharing their toughest challenges: what they had been through and what they were working to get through but were not sure if they could. I learned so much from my friends that night. I felt so thankful that I had them in my life and was able to reflect on my own formative experiences. Initially, I thought I would finish my last years as a camper then move on, but I realized how integral the role of camp counselors is to the camp environment; they define camp. That night, I decided that I would prioritize becoming a counselor and learning how to create an environment where kids feel comfortable opening up about subjects they’ve never been able to talk about and make friendships that lifelong friendships. I will never forget the place or the people, and I want to help create that feeling for others.
","1. Morning person alert! I somehow transitioned from being a complete night owl in high school to a morning fiend freshman year. Mornings are the best time of day. Before 9am, you can find me on a run with friends, taking on homework with a fresh mind, or frantically biking through the desert trying to see as much as possible before hostel checkout time. Especially at Stanford, mornings are a great time to dedicate to mental health; getting exercise, a productive start, or simply some alone time keeps me sane even during the most stressful times. No matter how late I fall asleep, my body is always ready to take on my favorite time of day because it is so important to my mental and physical health.
2. “All day long, I wander into traffic, walking like Charlie Chaplin, listening to a podcast while thinking about a different podcast.” John Mulaney put my life into words (although I prefer the term “Shaggy-ing” as in walking like Shaggy from Scooby-Doo.) I am constantly being made fun of for starting sentences with “So I was listening to this podcast..” From Dirtbag Diaries, to Freakanomics Radio, to Wine and Crime, my Spotify downloads contain quite a variety. For me, podcasts are a way to use times like walking to class to learn about topics that I find interesting and listen to different ways of storytelling. There is a podcast, a way to learn about passions/interests, for everyone.
3. Cheese. That is all.","Climbing was my most formative experiences as a camper. I learned how to push myself to conquer challenges. I facilitated climbing and high ropes at my childhood camp, YMCA Camp Ocoee, and was the climbing instructor at SSC. Encouraging kids to take one more step up a wall or through a ropes course teaches them to have confidence in themselves, and they can carry this confidence into other aspects of their lives. I am eager to be involved in this part of Kesem because I enjoy showing kids fun activities that gives them skills to overcome mental and physical challenges.
","My experience as a camper when I was younger was indisputably the aspect of my childhood that contributed the most to the person that I am today. My counselors showed me how to live a fun, meaningful, and unapologetic life. Today, many of my counselors are still my role models and many of my fellow campers are my best friends who I know I can always trust to be there to help me any time of day in any situation. As aforementioned, I went on to be a camp counselor for multiple summers because I want to be able to give that camp experience back to as many people as I can, and Kesem is an organization that would allow me to continue to do exactly that. I want to be the role model that my counselors were for me. In addition, I’ve heard first hand accounts from many Kesem counselors how  formative and rewarding of an experience it is to work with such a unique group of people and how honored they felt to learn from campers. The summer after my freshman year was the first summer that did not directly participate in the camp atmosphere, and I felt that loss immensely. Through Kesem, I can continue to pass on the “camp person” in me while learning from and giving back to a very important and special community.
","When I was younger, I would get inexplicably anxious over the smallest things, and my anxiety manifested itself in physical illness and weird rituals that became part of my daily routine. In middle school, I stopped wanting to go out with my friends or family because I was so nervous. I realized that I was missing out on a lot of fun experiences, so I started trying to say yes more often. As I slowly got out and did more, my anxiety lessened. It took a lot of effort, but I expanded my comfort zone which allowed me to have fun experiences, so I now encourage my peers and campers to do the same. I understand what it is like to have anxiety and to not want to do something that sounds fun which would be helpful at camp where there are a lot of new things to be anxious about. Through my experience, I am more in touch with indicators of anxiety in children and aware of what people in a counselor role (myself) can do to help (and moreover, what they should not do.) I am not a professional, but I can empathize and connect with campers who have anxiety inducing events occurring in their lives.
In addition, I grew up in the Bible Belt in a more liberal family that practiced both Judaism and Christianity, so I understand what it is like to not identify with those around me and how to learn from those experiences.

							                                          January 2014 to June 2018

Palo Alto Children’s Theater, Playhouse Series: Palo Alto Children’s theater is the second oldest and one of the most respected children’s theaters in the country. Perform in the Playhouse Series of shows, which occur once a month (with two weeks of practice to prepare).  Shows are geared towards providing 3 to 8 year olds with their first theater experiences.  Requires improvisational ability as children are encouraged to get involved. Amazing way to interact with kids, being able to take photos with them afterwards and see the smiles on their faces was always amazing. 

When I was younger I volunteered at Haven House, a home for families transitioning out of homelessness: took care of the little kids one night every month for a year while parents went to meetings.  We planned all the crafts/activities, played with them and read to them. 

I went to south africa the summer between 7th and 8th grade and worked with the kids in the Kliptown Youth Project, an after school educational enrichment program for kids in an low income area near Johannesburg.   

Babysitting various children ages 6 months - 10 (2012- Now)

Throughout high school I volunteered in my Kindergarten, 1st and 3rd grade classrooms as a teachers helper. I set up activities, helped with in class learning and helped kindergartens make art :) personally my favorite part.  

",I haven't had the opportunity to work at a camp. ,"Conservation Ambassadors 
An organization I have been involved with for many years is called Conservation Ambassadors, they are a rescue zoo for exotic animals which normally take in animals from the illegal pet trade. After taking in these animals they hand raise them so that they have the ability to bring these animals to schools and events to spread information about conservation of animals and habitats. Providing a tactile experience with these animals really makes kids remember and creates a new generation of carers. I personally help the origination transform their  space for the animals, I created den boxes and made more enrichment for the animals. I also helped during shows and outreach providing an extra hand to handle the animals and provide extra facts to curious kids after the show.  

Spirit and Social/ Peer Counseling
All throughout high school I was very involved with my schools spirit and social club and eventually ended up running it, I planned any thing and everything at my school starting something that will be part of my school for years to come. Being able to plan fun events whether it be a dance or a surprise bouncy house on our lawn being able to plan things that too away stress and made people smile was something I really loved. Along that vain of work, I also was part of the founding Peer Counseling group at my high school I spent the second half of my junior year in a class learning how to counsel people in our school from a therapist and in my senior year we actually, slowly but surely, started to instate the program and having students sign up. 

Travel 
I am very lucky to say that one of the most amazing things my parents have done is taking my siblings and I all over the world. Through that I have been able to work with schools, kids, organizations in Peru, Costa Rica, South Africa, Mongolia, and even Siberia. Being able to meet such a wide array of people has really shaped who I am as a person, and made me a global citizen. It’s made me want to discover stories, individuals stories. Being able to travel has caused a deep curiosity in how people become who they are and how their lives has shaped that, and how can I connect, because I believe in someway we all have connections. 
","Ok so when I was younger I was always outside, like always. My parents were big on that and creating fun for yourself and they didn’t care if there was a mess involved. So when I was moving into a new house we were building a pool but in that process we had a pit, a giant, dirt filled pit. And it rained. My little sister and I proceeded to spend the next week in the muddy pit building mudmen and mud angels (I grew up around here if you can’t tell I was snow deprived). My sister and I were honestly more excited to play in the mud than to get a pool.","I get very excited, if there is any opportunity to dress up or wear rally I will be going all out. With that I am pretty gosh darn outgoing. 

I have no idea what I want to do with my life but I want to help people. I don’t know how but I would love to do it in a way that I get to see the impact I make on an individuals life. 

I’ve always wished I was crafty. I have always wanted to make clothes. Not super relevant but a fun fact.","I don’t have many drawing skills but in looking at the video one of the counselors faces is covered in face paint so I would love to be a canvas. Help with the drop off maybe, I know at least for myself I could never go away for camp when I was younger because I got super homesick which I am sure is something that especially the younger kids go through. I also love learning and teaching card games. ","Honestly because the video on the website made me cry. It seems like a community of complete support and love, like walking into a hug and those places are hard to find. These kids must be so resilient and to have a place that is sure to put a smilie on their face must be pretty special. 

And a member of my band section talks so highly of this camp it must be amazingly unique.

","When I was 5 years old, I moved to a new town and a new school. My family had gotten a dog — a big, fluffy labradoodle — just a few months before we moved. His name was Riley and he was wildly untrained. On my first day of kindergarten, my whole family came to drop me off, including the dog. When I opened the back door of the car to get out, Riley jumped out with me and took off! Someone opened the door to the school and he ran inside. He was having the time of his life, licking everyone and everything that he could possibly get close to. Both of my parents and my brother and I were all sprinting frantically around the school trying to find him, and when we eventually did, he had a glove in his mouth that he had stolen from some cubby somewhere. It turned out that the glove belonged to another new kindergartener, and when I returned the glove, I made my first friend at my new school. Now he goes to Stanford with me!","1. I have an older brother and I feel like being a younger sibling is a big part of my identity
2. I’m from a tiny town and went to high school with 92 kids — and I also feel like that’s a big part of my identity
3. If I had to have a life mantra, it would be to take the things I care about incredibly seriously,  but to not take myself too seriously in the process :) 
","I would love to facilitate a big drum circle. Everyone would have something to make noise with, and we would all play in unison. There are a lot of fun things you can do to make it interesting — games to play, things to sing together, etc. Drum circles are inclusive, meditative, and have a way of making groups of people feel intimately connected. They also work as really great end-of-day rituals.

Alternatively, I would absolutely love to put on a magic show. I’m obsessed with magic and really bad at it — but that’s half the fun. 
","At Stanford thus far, I’ve missed two things most from my life in high school: getting involved with volunteer work and interacting with kids. I tried to apply to Kesem last year but couldn’t when I realized I was going to be abroad in the winter. While I was abroad, I accompanied one of my friends to their volunteer commitment as an English teacher at an Italian elementary school and helped them teach for a couple days. In those days, I remembered how much energy and life I get from working with kids — and how important it felt. The way Kesem brings happiness and community into the lives of kids that really need it feels very important to me in the same way. I want to volunteer my time to Kesem because I feel like I could give a lot and learn a whole lot, both in the name of an incredibly worthy cause. ",,"Most of the drum sounds, and all of the voices, came from Kesem promo material I found online! I added the organ and bass afterwards :)

","Thump! I fell down on my butt again. I feel slightly embarrassed, as I pick myself back up from the ice and giggle it off. Up ahead, my little brother is already attempting to do tricks on his ice skates. He learns so fast! Meanwhile, my little sister is breezily gliding along, graceful as a swan. My mom watches us from the benches and smiles, at peace. 

Even though I’m still a terrible ice skater, ice skating in the Boston Commons, an outdoor public skating rink open during winter break, was one of my favorite childhood memories. Growing up, my mom often worked multiple jobs and would come home late and exhausted, so my siblings and I would often have to take care of ourselves. I loved winter break and ice skating at Boston Commons because we all finally had time to rest, and our whole entire family was together. I especially loved grabbing a meal in the nearby area or simply enjoying a cup of hot cocoa after we skated. Even though I’ve traded the cold winter weather for California sunshine at Stanford, I’ll still miss ice skating in the Boston Commons. 
","One: I’m passionate about education and equal opportunities. After Stanford, I want to complete a mathematics teaching fellowship before graduate school. I enjoy working with children and inspiring them to achieve their goals or to consider new, unexplored paths. 
Two: I want to foster communities of empathy. All too often at Stanford, we are too caught up in our own lives and become obsessed with minutiae. I’m always trying to help my friends as we struggle together. I don’t want people to be scared of sharing their feelings or worries, especially since Stanford can perpetuate constant duck syndrome. 
Three: I love being creative. I love doodling during class and inadvertently messing up my clothes with paint. I think art brings out my inner kid, filled with excitement and imagination. 
","I’d love to teach an Art + Science workshop. I personally use art as therapy, and I also love exploring the intersection between art and science. School’s out so learning is probably the last thing on their minds, but I’d love to share with them how neurons work (because kids love neuroscience, oddly) and then let them draw their own colorful neuron-inspired art a la Santiago Cajal. We could bring in water colors/glitter/acrylic paints/t-shirt canvases and just let them go wild. ","During my childhood, my grandmother suffered from three types of cancer: lung, breast, and bone. This meant that my mom flew back home to be with her for half a year, leaving my siblings and I under the care of several rotating family members. From this experience, I experienced the long-lasting impact of a family member’s disease, leading me to wrestle with difficult concepts such as death. 
From my grandmother’s death, I became interested in oncology. I completed cancer research projects at Stanford and Harvard and shadowed an oncologist, Dr. Ryan Sullivan, back at home. During this shadowing experience, I also had conversations with a prominent palliative care specialist and my current mentor, Laura Petrillo at MGH, about the stigma surrounding palliative care and “depressing” conversations. These conversations spurred not only my interest in the scientific side of oncology, but also crucial patient interactions and difficult, end-of-life conversations. In the future, I want to explore a career in oncology or palliative care. 
Thus, at Camp Kesem, I want to foster communities of empathy, where counselors and campers alike can be open and share their feelings and struggles. I want to help kids know that whatever they are feeling is valid, and that I am always there for support. Lastly, I want to have fun this summer and reconnect with my inner child! 
","I come from a low-income family and have lived most of my life in an immigrant community in the outskirts of Boston. At Stanford, I am on full financial aid and participated in the Leland Scholars Program for FLI students. I particularly connect to low-income and immigrant children, as I taught many immigrant, low-income Chinese children in summer camp and had the same experience growing up. I also connect to children whose parents work full-time/multiple jobs and have financial stresses of paying for medical expenses/insurance, as I grew up without comprehensive health insurance. Additionally, my family struggled with paying for medical expenses, such as treatments for my grandmother’s cancer and my father’s diabetes.

","Sliding through the aisles of toys at the Dollar Tree, I scored a home run against my sisters in our game of baseball we made up out of mismatched items we found in the store. Given that Fargo is frozen eight months out of the year, I often used my imagination to form a winter playground out of the discount retail stores my mom would often take my sisters and I to. All three of us had overly-active imaginations - using our best judgement to wreak havoc on our fellow shoppers at Walmart, Kohls, and the Dollar Tree while my mom browsed the store. 

For me, seeing walls of endless merchandise gave me the feeling of living in a mansion with everything I could ever need. I'd stare up at the rows of fluorescent lights that stretched from end to end of the store and think about how they'd remind me of the rows of grain and corn that surrounded the outskirts of my city. Once I was old enough to jump out of my mom's cart, I would sprint down aisles analyzing sights, smells, and tactile touch of various dryer sheet brands, curtain fixtures, and display TVs I could find. 

I always appreciated my mom's will to let me join her during the shopping trips we would take each week. Memories and experiences like these made me passionately curious - opening up an unbreakable imagination I use to this day. 
","1) In my free time I like to run, bike, play violin, go stargazing, and eat Honey Bunches of Oats cereal.

2) I can lick my elbow (even though people say that it's physically impossible).

3) While I haven't been able to travel that much around the world, I love learning about new places and have a mild addiction to studying geography. I can name to the capital of every country, and love learning about the hometowns and cultures of everyone I meet. ","I've always considered myself a night owl, and would be excited to get away from all the light pollution of the Bay Area while at camp. For me, staring up at the sky and studying the constellations has always been a favorite pastime of mine. While learning more about dark sky preservation in Utah during my sophomore college, I made sure to go outside every night to look at the milky way and constellations that dotted the sky. I would be overjoyed to share that passion and curiosity with kids at Camp Kesem.","Everyone carries with themselves a unique perspective that is often used to mold and shape their present and future experiences. In many ways, this perspective is shaped by adversity that one has had to face from hardship within their family. Camp Kesem shares a collective consciousness around the impact of cancer, and has been experienced differently by every student that is a part of the program. While no one in my immediate family is currently affected by cancer, I've seen the diversity of experiences of cancer patients/survivors while working with Relay for Life. Being a part of the MITES program, which is meant to serve students from disadvantaged/minority backgrounds, I saw an energy of perseverance form even though many of these students faced immense roadblocks upon returning home or during the senior year of high school. 

My goal is to help the students that are part of Camp Kesem be empowered by the perspectives and stories of their fellow campers and feel like they're in a safe environment where they can be supported. On a personal level, I would also be excited to be inspired by each of the students I work with and give them a network they can keep in contact with after camp. Doing this within the MITES program gave me an amazing sense of fulfillment and I hope to have the chance to continue that in the future.","While I am excited to see the diverse set of interests, experiences, and backgrounds of the students at Camp Kesem, I particularly want help the students who feel alone in their experiences at home. 

Growing up knowing I was gay was particularly difficult in a state as conservative as North Dakota. I felt my identity as something I grappled with in secret - afraid of how my family and friends would react. In school, many of the academic challenges present became amplified as a first-generation low-income student. Navigating college, health insurance, and living away from home was a new experience for both me and my parents. Additionally, North Dakota can feel distant from in terms of resources and people to talk to. 

While I feel a sense of success given my ability to end up at Stanford, I still feel a sense of disconnect from my family as I go to study at a place so far from home both physically and culturally. There come a pressure to represent my family in a positive light while still caring for my sisters - a pressure shared by many of the kids at Camp Kesem who often have to grow up quickly as a result of an ill or deceased parent. 

Camp Kesem should be a place where students can feel comfortable with themselves. Additionally, I hope that the kids I work with can leave feeling empowered about themselves and that there are people who care about their story.

Through our program, these youth offenders would be diverted from the harsh Juvenile Justice System and would, in turn, receive community service and workshop sentences. I learned to communicate effectively with the teens who came through our program and assisted them effectively in getting them back on the right track in their lives. ","I still remember the first time I went on a vacation with my family. It was really special, because my family could never really afford to travel and take me places, even to this day. I’ve only been on one vacation since this particular one and I still have never left the state of California to this day. But I was about 6 years old at the time and my parents had finally saved up enough to go on a trip. We would be going to Yosemite National Park!

I remember driving in to the main entrance of the park and being taken aback in wonder of the beauty of nature around me. I grew up around neighborhood parks and city life, so the towering green trees and the giant mountains amazed me. I also saw snow for the first time and it was absolutely magical. I dove right in and started making snow angels and snowmen and having snowball fights with my mom and dad. The stillness of the water, the trees, the mountains, and the wildlife put me at ease and I imagined leaving the world and simply escaping into this new one that I found.

It was this little vacation that first introduced me to my love of nature and the escape it provides from the craziness of the rest of the world. I hope I can bring those same values to Camp Kesem and share that same peace of mind I found 12 years ago.      ","I’m resilient. I’ve faced a lot of financial and academic obstacles in my life being a first-generation low-income student and sometimes, the pressure of knowing that I have a family to support with my academic journey here can get to my head. But I keep my head strong and my heart full with nothing but love and support for the people around me and for those who got me where I am today. It’s this mindset that allows me to get back up and bounce back stronger and I hope to share that with our campers.

I never take myself too seriously. I love to joke around, make people smile when they’re feeling down and just be plain silly, so I’m looking forward to bringing that same energy and light-heartedness to Camp Kesem and in building close relationships with the campers!

Family is extremely important to me. I would most definitely not be where I am today without the endless support of my parents and the mentors I’ve been fortunate enough to have in my life. I believe that a strong support system is crucial to leading a happy and healthy life and I want to share these values of family and support with the campers, especially at a time when they feel like they’ve lost this part of their life.  ","I’d love to lead some kind of music programming during camp! I can use what I’ve learned from being a Music Program Coordinator for Kids with Dreams and facilitate an activity during camp. I can teach all the campers a musical routine with instruments that we make or that we might already have. We can learn some simple dance routines together or make a game out of choreography. Really anything music-related, I’d be super down to facilitate.  ","I had a very rough first year academically here at Stanford. I really struggled in all of my classes and many times along the journey, I felt like Stanford wasn’t the right place for me. But the summer after freshman year, I had some much-needed time to reflect and decided to spend my time doing one of the things I actually loved: working with kids. It’s one of my passions. They’re such a breath of fresh air and they just fill me with life and joy whenever I’m around them. That’s why I decided to be a camp counselor for a farm camp in Sunnyvale rather than trapping myself in a laboratory doing research, like many of my pre-med peers did. And it was the best choice I’ve made since coming to Stanford.

I realize now that pursuing this passion is extremely important to me. I’ve faced my share of struggles in my life and I can’t imagine how strong these kids must be to bear such heavy weight at such a young age. It makes my day to see kids smile and laugh without a care in the world and it would mean the world to me to get the opportunity to bring that joy back to the kids of Camp Kesem. To be there with them during their time of grief and hardship and to be able to show them the light at the other side would bring my own personal journey of adversity full-circle.","As a first-generation, low-income student of Hispanic heritage, throughout the course of my life, I’ve learned a great deal about struggle and overcoming adversity. From scrambling to pay the bills every month to embracing the importance of family and love in hardship, I feel that many of the same struggles I’ve faced and the values I’ve learned are similar to the obstacles that the kids of Camp Kesem have to deal with. I believe that my experiences contribute an important perspective to the myriad backgrounds that the rest of the camp counselors come from and will be a valuable asset in learning how we, as counselors, can establish the strongest support system possible for our campers. I hope that my personal experiences with resilience in the face of adversity will make it easier for me to create meaningful relationships and tight bonds with the campers and that I can be there for them as a source of strength when they feel that their fight becomes too much to bear.","The light at the end of the tunnel,
We ceaselessly strive to reach it. 
Despair overshadows hope, 
Pain overwhelms closure,
Sorrow drowns out joy.
But still, we march undyingly forward,
Fearless of what we have yet to see,
Have yet to feel,
For darkness will give way to the light indeed.
And through it all,
On this arduous journey of purpose,
We lift our voices for catharsis
And open our souls to grace.
We harden not our hearts, but our fortitude.", (https://hillelatstanford.wufoo.com/cabinet/enlrZWg3azE3amFrMmk=/IAA19ITvVKM%3D/),Julian Aguilar,12/6/18, (https://hillelatstanford.wufoo.com/cabinet/enlrZWg3azE3amFrMmk=/IAA19ITvVKM%3D/),Julian Aguilar,12/6/18,12/6/18 16:09,public,12/6/18 23:58,public,128.12.254.132,6,1

LIT at Camp Becket, designing activities, working to support counselors and generally interacting with campers.
","Camp Becket – Member of REACH, Counselor for 24 twelve to thirteen year old boys over two summers, Mentored a member of REACH 2018, helped him gain experience counseling and begin to explore his own counseling style.

Sioux YMCA – Volunteered as REACH Counselor at day camp and weekly sleep-away camp Marrowbone, helped in their community outreach programs by working with children in outlying communities. Volunteered to help with their after-school programs. Volunteered to help with the running of community pow wows, such as Pioneer Days and Iron Lightning.
","Every other summer I was a camper at Becket (two of the four years), my dad would show up late to Dad’s Weekend. It was never really expected, and while everyone was hanging out with their dad or alumni mentor, I would wander camp alone, a little down and very bored.
My dad always showed up the next day, but the anticipation was always filled with anxiety and restlessness. One year, Nate the Aide found me, and instead of being caught up in noticing how everyone else was hanging out with their dad, I was caught up in the moment, making a bracelet at Creative Arts, throwing a disc on the green, going to buy a fruitful and walk around talking. Nate turned my day from the worst of that session to one of the best.
Years later, as a REACHer, I realized that this wasn’t just some spontaneous thing, where Nate had randomly found me, but that counselors and aides had all known my dad hadn’t gotten there yet, and Nate had been asked to spend time with me. Although it changed my perspective of that memory, it didn’t change the fact that that was a great day. If anything, it gave me something to focus on, to always strive for in working as a counselor, not only helping my campers grow, but to create the experience of a lifetime, whether through a great game, or just a good memory.","First thing to know about me – I get pretty goofy when I’m at camp. Usually this really came out in my rushed activity planning, like when I would plan a cabin activity during breakfast, going something like “Hmm, I like eggs, I should be one for my activity today” and then 30 minutes later I’d be running around dressed as an egg screaming and trying to steal a rubber chicken, all while not being “broken” by smaller sockball eggs. To be honest, great game. Campers love themes.
Second thing – I go through a heavy self-destruction cycle where I work myself almost to death and then crash. Luckily, that takes about two weeks and then I just sleep for an entire day off, so I should be fine at Kesem since it’s just a week. Yay.
Finally, my best counseling moments are in small groups of three or four campers. I sometimes feel a little awkward talking to really large groups of people, even if I look fine. In reality I’m freaking out inside and so have no mental capacity for coming up with a joke. I swear I’m not trying to look serious or bored I just can’t focus on what I’m making my face do.
In all seriousness though, I do plan a lot last minute but I know myself and how that pans out, I do stay up late for no reason, and I really feel like I do my best work in smaller group settings.
","I would be really excited to run a cabin chat at Kesem, though Kesem probably has something similar. At Becket, it essentially involves lighting a candle in the middle of the cabin, a counselor asking what is usually a somewhat personal question, and then allowing others to answer if they choose to. Campers are encouraged to respond, and rarely does one acknowledge another’s answer. The purpose isn’t so much to learn other people’s answers are (to be honest, I can’t remember most of my campers’ chat answers) but to share in the knowledge that you were vulnerable with each other.","Each summer at Becket, there’s an emphasis on what we do, but especially for REACHers (LITs who went to the Cheyenne River Reservation), there’s the knowledge that there are people out there who are more in need of the resource that we, as counselors, represent for youth (especially male youth, since Becket is an all-boys camp). Becket emphasizes personal growth, and encourages counselors (all of whom were campers) to return multiple summers in a row to continue to spread and teach the Becket Way to campers. Yet at the same time, there’s a sense that we could be doing more, could be impacting lives outside of that bubble.
Kesem is the perfect place for me to act on this, to go and impact children beyond the small Becket community. It gives me the chance to help create an experience totally apart from normal everyday life, free of the weights we hold from one day to the next. Kesem campers are children more in need of that escape from the real world, more in need of a place that’s a temporary bubble, than almost any other group I have worked with, and I feel driven to help provide for them that safety from the outside world, that experience, as I always try to for any of my campers.
","My time on the Reservation was eye-opening. I worked with children whose parents had abandoned them, who were being raised by grandparents, aunts, or uncles. I saw children who had a life at home I couldn’t even imagine. One of the communities I worked in was Red Scaffold, a collection of mobile homes about an hour from the closest town. That was where I met Osidro, a twelve-year-old boy who had just moved from Rapid City to live with his grandmother, after his mom passed away earlier that year. We hung out, played games on their playground, sat under a bridge for a while and just talked. My leaders always told us, though, that we weren’t there to solve a problem. We were there to change a life, to impact a relatively small group of children by giving them an experience without the things that haunt them back home.
I don’t know exactly what it’s like to have a parent affected by cancer. I hope I never learn that way. But I do know that whatever it is you live with, it can’t be solved in a week. I’m not going to solve whatever emotional hardships my campers are going through. I’m going to give them relief from them, a moment to breathe while the world seems still, a moment of support while they find their footing. So that when they go to confront those emotions, they’ll know that they’re strong.

","My little brother and I were best friends out of necessity—friends were always moving to the new and improved houses further up the hill, getting helplessly relocated with their fathers’ jobs, and outgrowing our favorite games. When we felt lonely as two, we would include the plants in our stories. Trees became mothers and mansions, rocks became islands and ice cream toppings, and flowers became treasures and treaties. The plant that meant the most, however, was the one we didn’t understand. In the bushes were these little green gourd-shaped nothings. They were never eaten by the bunnies, never picked by the gardeners, never forcibly removed by the parents. I opened one once, but didn’t like the scent, so I threw it away (I remember it smelling a bit like a fig, which I ironically love now). Turns out, they were more useful to us in tact. We began picking them one by one and then in bulk, taking sharpies to their skin, drawing on ages and emotions and wardrobes. We called them “Jug-Jugs.” Soon enough, we had dozens of them, a whole metropolis. We sent them to school, to work, and a few (tragically) to graves (do not fret, they had elaborate and heartfelt funerals). I learned to love their namelessness because it meant that I could create it myself—my imagination reached new levels of ridiculous and nonsensical and enthralling. It was childhood fun in its purest form, and it made my brother and I feel far less alone. 
","I’ve been going to camp since I was in fourth grade, and every summer I’ve had to sacrifice other things for it—camp was always first priority. I loved everything part, from the shopping for ridiculous costumes in our team colors to the crazy card games on the bus, and of course, being somewhere so far it felt like the world was all yours. It was a perfect opportunity for escape from all the things that made the real world stressful and too fast-paced to take in. Camp gave me my favorite memories with my best friends and mentors, and I’m still in contact with many of those people. In addition to my deeply-rooted love for camp, I am passionate about working with children—they are quite literally my favorite type of human. I admire their candor, their spontaneity, their sense of wonderment and adventure, and above all, the way they articulate their feelings. They’re rarely ashamed, and they’re almost always empathetic to others—it’s a reflex to them. In other words, working with kids is my happy place. Lastly, I consider myself a creative person—no Van Gogh, surely, but I love art. I can spend hours with magazines and mod podge or with a pen and paper in hand. I see my creative tendency as something that will help me to work with and relate to the campers as well as design something beautiful for them to participate in. (Writing poetry also works quite well for writing scavenger hunt clues, I’ve noticed). 
","I’d love to be able to teach and facilitate collage at camp. I know personally that it gives kids without innate or trained “artistic talents” a chance to create art they are proud of. The magic of it lies in that it is the furthest thing from a scientific process. I’ve used magazine cutouts, photos, washi tape, glitter, and makeup to create my pieces, so I see no reason why leaves found on the campground or excess duct tape we discover can’t be included too. I’d love to see what kids can create if given the space to do so. 
","Growing up, there was always a woman in my family in treatment or remission, and eventually my fears were validated when I lost my grandmother last spring to metastasized kidney cancer. Although my mother has always been open to talking about it, I didn’t see her as a confidant until my later years of high school. Instead, I kept all my feelings surrounding the illness to myself. The first time I ever really cried about it stemmed from my anger about my grandmother’s hopeless condition last winter. My best friend Mia had also lost her mother to cancer in middle school, and she coaxed out of me the sentiments I should have been speaking about far earlier. I was terrified of losing my aunt, of my mother being diagnosed, and even of my own future risk. Cancer is heart-wrenching like no other epidemic for me personally, both because of my family’s experience with it and because of watching one of my best friends go through teenage girl drama and high school dance makeup prep without a mother. I want to volunteer my time at Camp Kesem to allow children a space to feel, grieve, or just have a blast. I want to be the shoulder to cry on, but so much more—the hands to hold, the feet to stomp around in mud with, and the pitchy singing voice they join. This camp fills such a unique purpose, and I’d be honored to be a part of that team effort. 
","Throughout my elementary and middle school years, I stayed quiet in class and had trouble in group settings; I asked the questions that were too hard for adults to answer, like why some kids didn’t get to go to school or why bad things happened in the world. It wasn’t just curiosity, but a constant avalanche of thoughts that never slowed. I was petrified of never being good enough for friends or my family and horrified at the world’s tragedies. Although time healed some, high school stresses brought me to a difficult place of confronting my mental health once again as I started to experience deep fatigue and dissatisfaction with my life. I was lucky enough to have supportive friends as well as dedicated parents who brought me to a psychiatrist who prescribed me depression medication before my situation became severe, but walking with depression has continued to be an act of perseverance. I’ve tried to train myself out of seeing my mental illness as a crutch or my defining characteristic, and instead working towards desensitizing the mass population to it and empathizing with others who are fighting the same battles. Although this experience is difficult to be vocal about, I’d like to be transparent in honor of the childlike candor that I so admire and for the sake of inspiring children experiencing the same. If nothing else, I can be a friend to a child who, like me, hasn’t had the easiest time making them.

","Red carpet, clapperboard, paparazzi, and celebrities all made an appearance at the birthday party my siblings and I had planned to a T when I turned 12. Granted, the clapperboard fell apart a few times, paparazzi had a shaky hand, and the celebrities were just me and my best friends, but to date, this is a childhood memory that sparkles exceedingly brightly. As famous musicians, we jammed out for hours, talked in posh accents, and ate a delicious meal from star themed glass wear. As celebrities undercover, we got to appreciate the mundane, walking around the neighborhood feeling blessed to have made it “undetected” by the nosy public. As kids having fun, we got to eat dessert, laugh, and play hide and seek in the dark. Not only that, hours later we found ourselves on a shed roof wrapped in blankets with a bag of MandMs looking at the stars. The night was objectively special, but to me, it marked my first sleepover, a long-awaited candy overdose (not easy to do when you’re a mom is a nutritionist), the start of friendships that I still have today, and the birth of my adventurous self.
","The first thing I would have you know is that I speak French. I say this not to brag in any way but rather to segway into the second thing you should know which is: I don’t have favorites, BUT if I were to have a favorite concept in the entire world it would be linguistic determinism. This is the idea that language shapes thought and that experience is limited by our capacity to articulate it. (If this idea vibes with you, you might want to check out the Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows blog online). The third thing that I might want you to know is that I love to kvell over my siblings. In yiddish, kvelling is simply “gushing” or “being extraordinarily proud” of one’s siblings and as a middle child of five, I certainly like to do that.","Salsa dancing (or basic ballroom dancing in general)! But to be honest I would love to do so many things….I have a lot of experience in cooking (all types but cake decorating in particular), climbing, general outdoor activities, yoga instructing, book reading, painting, golf ...etc.","If I could have any superpower, I would choose healing. Unlike other summer camps that focus on fun, I think that Kesem will be a place that focuses on fun but with the aim of healing and growth in children that have been forced to grow up too quickly. There is nothing I would rather do with my time than be a part of that healing and growth. Also fundamentally, my purpose is wrapped up in love and hope, things that I would get to foster in some of the most vulnerable members of our society as a Kesem counselor. The stories that I have heard about Kesem and the people I know who are part of Kesem are individuals that I deeply admire and strive to be like. I want to volunteer my time to Kesem because I think it will be a chance to love others (kids and counselors alike) in a unique context while becoming the best version of myself.","Each community needs something different in terms of diversity, but something that I think is noteworthy is that I am half Asian and half white. My dad is Chinese Malaysian with his entirely family in still in Malaysia and my mom is from Texas.

The quality of the photo might be crummy, but, then again, so is the toast itself. In the theme of childhood, I chose to make food art. Cinnamon honey toast used to be the food that got made in my house when anyone was sad. A small gesture like toast with a heart written in honey, a hug, and an ear to listen goes a long way to dry tears. In addition to the love from my family, the piece reminds me of the love that I share with my best friend who opened a cake decorating ""business"" with me in middle school. To be honest, creating this was what I needed this week. It helped me to slow down, come up with a few puns, and think of ways I have felt loved and can go on to love the kids at Kesem.", (https://hillelatstanford.wufoo.com/cabinet/enlrZWg3azE3amFrMmk=/F1JmwuBeE35eHY%3D/),Faith Koh,12/6/18, (https://hillelatstanford.wufoo.com/cabinet/enlrZWg3azE3amFrMmk=/F1JmwuBeE35eHY%3D/),Faith Koh,12/6/18,12/6/18 17:08,public,12/6/18 23:25,public,128.12.252.4,6,1

My mom was pulling the last batch of blank sugar cookies from the oven and she placed them on a rack that looked like it was about to snap under the weight of the other canvases that sat and cooled before them. “You’ll shoot your eye out” chanted in the background as my grandma called the entire family into our dining room. Like a Christmas rainbow, the dining table had been transformed with piles of icing and sprinkles. We each took our place at our decorating station, me next to my grandpa since we were the biggest competitors, all hoping to beat the legendary nativity scene my halabeoji had painted on a cookie the year I was born. I was determined. For an hour and a half, the table was a candy coated war zone. As a powdered sugar dust fell over the decorating stations and every cookie had either been decorated, eaten, or left as a “snack for later” I smiled. My grandma broke the post-cookie carnage silence with a laugh while gesturing to the large, bright green, frosting stain on my dad’s white shirt. Everyone let out an exhausted chuckle and began to make their rounds to vote for their favorites. That was one of the last times my family was together before my grandma passed away, but I’ll always remember it fondly. Especially because that was the year I won our annual cookie contest","I'm fiercely dedicated to and love deeply, my entire family whether they are my blood family or the people who I have been blessed enough to otherwise have in my life. It doesn't matter when, where, or why, if I am needed, I will be there. 
I express my culture through my love of food. Every quarter during dead week, I make homemade Korean food for my friends and anyone who feels that they a cheerful pick-me-up or good luck on their stressful week to come. All are always invited and all are always welcome.
I have a deep passion for sloths. At this moment, in my room, there are upwards of 20 individual sloth related items including a mug, a calendar, a pencil case, and a tea infuser, just to name a few. They are a reminder to me to take the time to slow down and enjoy life rather than sprinting around. 
","My philosophy is that it’s hard to be upset with a full stomach. Food has been an integral part of my life since I was young. It was the center of many of the traditions that my family celebrated and has always been a way for me to reconnect with old friends as well as make new ones. At camp, I would love to find myself leading activities that are centered around food related activities like building structures like marshmallow towers or an activity close to gingerbread house making, so campers could have some fun and eat it too!","When I was younger, about the same age as many of the campers at Kesem, my family received two very difficult prognoses . My grandmother, with whom I was very close, had taken a negative turn in her battle with stage IV pancreatic cancer. That same summer, my mom suffered from a stroke that was caused by a ruptured brain aneurysm. I was fortunate that she made a full recovery, but at a very pivotal point in my life, I had my two role models for strong females stripped from me. The kids at Kesem have experienced a hardship unlike any other. To watch a parent, someone who is supposed to be a pillar of strength in the eyes of the child, go through an illness that can seem unending is a feeling with which I identify. Kesem gives the opportunities for young kids who may feel lost to find support, joy, and community. The bonds that campers form with each other and with their counselors reflect the ones that I found outside of my immediate family with people who I now count to be family because of their warmth and love. I want to be a support system for these kids and give them someone to talk to when it can be difficult to speak to family. I hope to be a role model for them and to show them compassion and light in a very difficult and often dark time that others helped to show to me. ","One of the parts of me that I feel is very integral to my identity is my mixed race background. I am half Korean and half white. I grew up in an area that was predominantly Asian with large numbers of first and second generation children. Because of this, I tended to feel less like my peers because of the way that I look, talk, and act. It always made me feel like I was an imposter. I ended up spending a month in Korea learning about the culture and the history while staying with some family. Through this experience I was still looked at as ""not Korean"" and this taught me that my identity is not defined by others. Going through this process taught me to reclaim my heritage and my own racial identity regardless of the way that I am defined by others. My journey has made me want to guide others. In a time when so many of these campers are discovering who they are and may be questioning different parts of themselves, I feel like I can use my own journey towards self acceptance to lead others towards the same.

",I have not had any experience working at Camp Kesem.,"1. Girl Scouts
In 2014, my hometown area was ranked as the most food-insecure in the United States.  Therefore, I decided to make combating hunger the focus of my Gold Award project and created an herb-and-vegetable garden at a local elementary school from which I donated produce to the Greensboro Urban Ministry, along with educational posters promoting consumption of non-processed foods.  Through the year-long project, I helped address a critical situation in my hometown, made a garden whose growth elementary school children could observe, and taught gardening skills to students from my high school.

2. Grimsley High School Science Olympiad
During my junior and senior years of high school, I was the President of the varsity and junior varsity Science Olympiad teams at my school.  My responsibilities included leading team meetings, organizing communications, assigning events, t-shirt designing, and facilitating the ordering process for t-shirts and snacks.  Most importantly, I served as a mentor to around thirty other students and promulgated the benefits of pursuing science and encouraging diversity to others.

3. IT is for Girls Camp
For the past four years, I have been involved with the IT is for Girls summer camp, which exposes diverse groups of middle-school girls to the world of IT.  As a Program Leader, my roles included writing an extensive proposal to receive grant funding from the National Center for Women in IT, an in-depth final report, and lesson plans. I mentored the campers, directed my team, took pictures and videos, and collaborated on the t-shirt design.  Through my leadership, I strove to be a purveyor of feminism, and encouraged girls to follow their dreams in typically male-dominated fields.  

","“Tutuli putuli!  Jaag as-veh?” my grandmother called.
Darling butterfly!  Are you awake? 

The sound of crackling oil and the smell of freshly fried vadas floated into the room and I knew my grandma was cooking up a storm.  This was the summer of 2009; my mother and younger brother were staying with my maternal grandparents, my father was back in the States, and I had my paternal grandparents all to myself, indubitably meaning that I was being spoiled rotten and relishing every second.

“Go outside and see what’s going on,” my grandmother chuckled.

I skipped outside, still in my Hello Kitty sleep shorts, and was equally bewildered and wonderstruck.  A man, with skin the rich color of toasted coffee beans, with a towel wrapped tightly around his forehead and shirt rolled up to the elbows, was scaling the 40-foot coconut tree in the corner of my grandparents’ compound.  He propelled himself up the curved trunk with a monkey’s ease, using his hands and feet to grip.  At the top, he hacked at the stems of the chartreuse-colored coconuts with a sickle and let them fall to his partner below.  We later hacked open the coconuts, drank their water, and slurped the snow-white meat.  
This situation taught me that anyone can do anything, no matter his or her background.  It is imperative to find intrinsic motivation when carrying out tasks.  The man was less than a seventh of the tree’s height, but still managed to shimmy up effortlessly.
","I love having late-night conversations with quintessential late-night snacks.  If anyone wants to talk, needs a shoulder to cry on or a reassuring hug, or someone to giggle with, I am always ready and willing.  I like making snacks redolent of home and am good at actively listening and offering comfort.  If a camper ever feels lonely and wants to talk, or someone just to sit in silence with, I will be ready with bowls of homemade avocado mac-and-cheese and mugs of steaming hot chocolate, no matter what time.

In 2015, I lost my maternal grandmother to aggressive forms of ovarian and colon cancer.  Her death profoundly affected my family’s lives and we became even more health-conscious.  Before she married and had children, she was the headmistress of a school that she founded and positively impacted many schoolchildren, who otherwise might not have received an education with her compassion and ardor for promoting equity; I would like to do the same by providing gentle care and attention to children whose lives have been affected by their parents having cancer because I understand the feeling of living in painful uncertainty and want to comfort those who might otherwise not have a support system.  

I’m a music aficionado; whenever I’m not busy doing work or having a conversation, I cannot help but sing and dance.  I enjoy sight-reading new music, making funky beats, learning new songs, and group-singing.  Additionally, I’m currently trying to learn how to use ProTools, a music production software.
","I would love to teach a class on fun photo-taking techniques such as light-painting and star-trail landscapes, which are accessible to all ages and yield awe-inspiring results.  Light-painting involves taking long-exposure shots with a moving light source and star-trail landscape photos depict star movements; these sessions could include stargazing and constellation identification tips.  Additionally, I would like to facilitate camaraderie between campers and counselors.  Through camps and my Girl Scout project, I have seen how strangers can gel and become families—an inspiring process.  Accordingly, I would like to help make Camp Kesem’s compassionate, welcoming environment accessible to all.","In August of 2017, my father unexpectedly passed away at the gym.  I was with him, my mother was out of town, and my brother and grandfathers were at home.  I still cannot put into words how heart-wrenching it is to lose a parent, especially now, when I feel so impressionable.  With our family and friends’ kind generosity, I know there will always be people to support me. I aspire to follow in my father’s footsteps and dedicate my life and profession to helping children and adolescents.  I would like to have a career in which I can develop educational programs for underprivileged children.  To realize this work, I need to be completely comfortable with interacting with children of all ages.  I have already had highly positive experiences mentoring students; their passion for learning and having fun is invigorating.  Having experienced profound emotional pain myself, I would like to hearten and solace children who are undergoing the same by assuring them that although current times are unbearably difficult, and it is impossible to forget how cancer and death have afflicted life, closure eventually comes.  Helping someone cope and find happiness again is gratifying, and I would like to do so for those who have their whole lives ahead of them—children.  Even in today’s arduous times, when people are killing and discriminating in the name of religion, race, gender, culture, and socioeconomic status, my experience has shown me that there can always be faith in humanity and its steel-strong camaraderie.  ","I currently come from a low-income household, so I truly empathize with families that have loved ones with cancer and understand the stress that families undergo when there is uncertainty about paying bills and acquiring resources that are indispensable to leading healthy, prosperous lives.  In 2016, my brother suffered from a liver laceration after a sledding accident and was hospitalized for ten days and could not attend school for a month.  Through the traumatic experience of seeing my brother endure inconceivable levels of pain, I believe that I grew as a person and sibling, becoming more aware of my surroundings and enhancing my abilities to relate to other people.  I am a member of Stanford’s Cancer Coalition student group, an organization that advocates and volunteers in various events to raise money for cancer research.  In high school, I was President of the Flute Ensemble for three years; I organized repertoire for the concerts, led the rehearsals, and coordinated concerts at local nursing homes.  At the nursing homes, we interacted with the residents, many of whom would likely be alone for portions of the holidays.  Accordingly, it was heartwarming to spread feelings of good cheer to those who otherwise might feel unsupported and a bit forlorn.  I am of Asian descent, and speak my mother tongue, Konkani, and Spanish fluently.  Additionally, I can speak conversational Portuguese.  I am a staff writer for The Grind in the Stanford Daily and a member of the Flute Ensemble.","This is a link to a YouTube video that I made:

","Role: Portland Art and Cultural Center Summer Program Director

Description: I organized a one week summer day camp for 8-12 year olds. Kids had the opportunity to participate in singing, dancing, martial arts, and painting classes. This camp was offered free of cost since many of the kids came from low income families. The camp concluded in a showcase for students to display what they learned over the week.
","Role: Bridge to Care Counselor @ Pacific Free Clinic
Dates: November 2017 - Present
Description: Through this position, I help people from underserved communities in San Jose gain access to healthcare services. Since this is a transitional clinic, I have connected patients with primary care physicians so that are able to receive long term care. Meeting these patients and their families and learning about their stories has been one the most humbling experiences I’ve had at Stanford.

Role: Alzheimer’s Buddies, Founding Director
Dates: September 2017 - Present
Description: I helped to start this student organization at Stanford that partners with local retirement homes to combat the social isolation caused by dementia. We pair students with alzheimer’s residents in intergenerational partnerships in order to celebrate what is still left in the alzheimer’s resident. This position has given me the valuable experience of working with and bringing people from opposite ends of the age spectrum together.
","When my mother and her siblings left Vietnam, they all settled in Portland, Oregon. Growing up, every Friday night I would go to my grandma’s house and get to see all of my relative’s from my mom’s side of the family. During these Friday night dinners, my cousins and I would love to create dances and shows for our parents. My favorite childhood memories are of these nights, when we would laugh and fight over who got to choreograph the dance that week. I was very fortunate to be surrounded by so many loving family members growing up. These memories have instilled in me the values of family, support, and love. I hope that as a counselor at Camp Kesem, I am able to bring these values and help to create this family among all members of camp.
","The first thing to know about me is that I am a picky eater. While this may be a difficult challenge at camp, I believe that it will help me better relate to the campers since I’m really still a kid at heart (not a fan of brussel sprouts). The second thing to know about me is that I believe fun is greatly undervalued in our society. I think that having fun is a necessity, no matter what age you are. After starting college, I’ve made it a goal to set aside time every week to do something I enjoy, like catching up with a friend I haven’t seen in a while or playing games with my younger cousins over facetime. I am so excited to be a counselor at Camp Kesem because I believe that having fun can also be a very therapeutic experience. The last thing that you should know about me is that I am dedicated and loyal. I approach everything that I do with one hundred percent and make sure that I do it to the best of my ability. If chosen to be a counselor, I will make sure that I do everything in my ability to create the most fun and meaningful experiences for our campers!",I would love to help teach music at Camp Kesem. Music played a large role in shaping my childhood and I believe that it is a great way for people of any age to have the opportunity to express themselves. I think that it is especially important for children whose parents have been affected by cancer to have these avenues of self expression. I would love to lead sing-alongs or jamming sessions around the campfire. These activities are what I remember most from my summer camp experiences as bringing the entire camp together.,"I want to volunteer at Camp Kesem because I think that it is important for children to have opportunities to have fun and meet other children who are experiencing similar challenges to themselves. Some of my fondest memories from my childhood are of going to summer camp and singing with friends around a campfire. I believe that all children should have access to these experiences, and I strongly support Camp Kesem's mission in providing this to kids who are facing especially difficult circumstances. I love working with children and being around them because it gives me hope for future generations. Kids deserve the chance to just be kids!

","Student Tour Guide at the Stanford Visitor Center: I started as a tour guide last spring and worked full time this past summer giving tours to prospective students and their families, school groups, as well as general tourists and visitors. It’s been an exciting experience to be an ambassador for the university and to be able to share my experiences with high school students. Heading into Stanford, there were a lot of parts of the Stanford experience that I was uncertain about and it’s been rewarding to be a sounding board for students as they navigate the stressful college admissions process.

Stanford club baseball: I’ve been playing baseball since I was five years old and it’s always been a massive part of my life. When I started at Stanford, I originally thought that my baseball career was over, but I found the club team and it’s quickly become one of my favorite communities on campus. After playing on the team as a freshman, I was elected president in the spring, and this year has definitely been a test in terms of my administrative and planning skills, but it’s also been fun to run an organization on campus and help develop an athletic community that has always been important to me. 

Manovill Holocaust History Fellowship: Starting my sophomore year of high school, I was accepted to the fellowship where I was paired with a local Holocaust survivor who I interviewed every month over the course of the year. I wrote a biography of his life and developed a close friendship with the survivor. As a member of the fellowship, I also helped plan the Bay Area Day of Learning, a Holocaust remembrance and education event for over 800 Bay Area high school students, where they were able to meet survivors and learn about the Holocaust. The larger fellowship community was very special, but the highlight of the experience was getting to know the survivor in my community and building a relationship with him. He became very close friends with me and my family until his death two years ago. 
","Growing up with three younger sisters in a large family, most of our family vacations were road trips of some form. Many of my favorite childhood memories happened on these road trips, either silly arguments with my siblings in the backseat, spontaneous diner stops at random locations throughout the west coast, or just the simple joy of family time. One specific memory that stands out is one of our road trips to Oregon when we stopped at Crater Lake. I remember walking out to the edge looking out over the lake with my whole family there and it was a moment of pure awe for nature and love for family intertwined in the same instant. ","My dream jobs would either be editor-in-chief of the New York Times or a Hollywood screenwriter. 

I have a pet leopard gecko who’s 15 years old and showing no signs of slowing down, despite the fact I’m a horrible pet owner. 

I can say the alphabet backwards in under 5 seconds (but don’t quiz me on it— I’m bad under pressure). 
","I would be excited to facilitate any sports or outdoor games at camp, as I have a lot of experience running those types of activities and I love sports in general. I also love to write and tell stories, so if there any creative writing workshops or storytelling roles or activities, I would love to facilitate those as well!","Camp Kesem seems like the single most special community on campus to be part of—both for the Stanford people that you get a chance to grow close with, and, most importantly, the children whose lives you get to impact. I’ve always loved working with kids through summer camp counseling, tutoring, and as an older brother of three sisters. I would embrace the opportunity to be a mentor and a friend to these kids and to provide a spark of happiness, energy and some good campfire storytelling as they deal with some serious challenges and hardships. ","Since I’ve arrived here at Stanford, I’ve tried to do a better job of reflecting on my the experiences I’ve had, both in the past and the present, and how these experiences have shaped me into the person I am today. There’s many different experiences and communities I could talk about, but one that has recently been at the front of my mind is my relationship to the Jewish community. 

I was raised Jewish but never felt especially in touch with religion. If anything, I always felt more of an external pressure to be Jewish. A few recent events have changed my perspective on this and made me at least more cognizant of my religious identity and my family’s connection to Judaism. With the shootings at the synagogue in Pittsburgh, a synagogue where my mom had her Bat Mitzvah, I felt an even stronger connection to family and religion. My Jewish identity is still weak. But, from a cultural and familial perspective, I’ve felt a much more powerful sense of purpose and a dedication to carrying on traditions and beliefs. 

I would imagine that many campers at Camp Kesem would have questions about their family and their family’s identities, especially as their families face tremendous hardships. I think that my ongoing struggle that I’ve felt since the tragedy in October would allow me to connect with campers as they too try to better understand their connection to family and community in the midst of hardship. 
","This is a picture I took in September of a squirrel enjoying a nice view of the Grand Canyon. Here are the thoughts going through the squirrel’s head as I took the photo:

Who are these strange creatures with their black boxes hanging around their necks and strange white flashes going off in short bursts? Is he seriously eating an ice cream cone on the rim of the Grand Canyon? Disgusting humans. I come out here to the edge to escape the chaos of my little squirrel life and enjoy a nice panoramic view and instead I get interrupted by two blond-haired beasts making noise and flashing lights at me. This is the problem with human capitalism. What’s the point of the National Park Service if they aren’t going to protect me from these crazy people? Ruining all of our fancy view spots. This is what we talked about at our latest community town hall meeting—how to get rid of these unwanted visitors.

You are allowed the opportunity to forget your problems for a bit and learn more about yourself while enjoying the beauty of nature. I’m very grateful for my first experience in the outdoors with the Student Conservation Association. It was such a transformative experience for me that I want to do anything in order to give others a similar inspiring experience. I also participated in SPOT on a backpacking trip and am currently taking Outdoor 101 and plan to fulfill other requirements such as Wilderness First Aid to become an outdoor trip leader. ,"I volunteered at a local daycare that my mom’s friend owned and worked with children in elementary school, helping to lead arts and sports activities. I also have a younger brother who is in 4th grade currently and because my parents were busy with work, I spent a lot of time taking care of him or monitoring his playdates with other kids. Finally, I had a private tutoring practice during my junior and senior years of high school and tutored local students ranging from elementary school to high school. At one point, I had up to 8 regular weekly clients. I get really invested in my kids and have only had positive feedback from my work with them. 

","Although I have not yet worked at a sleepaway summer camp, I worked at the summer day camp at my high school a few summers ago. I was a teacher assistant and helped my group of kids understand concepts in various subject areas. I also worked as an administrative assistant at a local afterschool. My responsibilities included grading tests and holding office hours for students to come and talk and work on their homework.

","Although I was born in the US, I lived in China from when I was 6 months old to 5 years old and continued went back to visit every summer. I loved traveling and exploring China, and the trip to Mongolia was one of favorites. I distinctly remember the feeling of the wind blowing past me and the power I felt when I rode a wild mustang. I was only 8 and had decided that the horse is my favorite animal. Though I do get swayed by cute puppies, the horse will always hold a special place for me. ","If theres one animal that I embody, it would be a mama bear. Multiple people especially my crew members on outdoor trips have told me this. I become very protective. 

Swimming has always been a part of my life, and its something that gave me community and passion early on in my life. I remember going to States one year when I was 8 years old with my friends, and it was such a good time because we know we worked so hard to get there. 

I love reading, which is rooted in my love for stories whether it's through books or other people. I get lost easily in a well constructed world. One day, I would like to write a book. 
",I would love to help out with the jam sessions/sing-alongs with my ukelele. There’s something so incredible about a large group of people working towards one goal and nothing is more accessible to that experience than creating music together through our voices. Music has always been a part of my life and is such a powerful tool in healing and to make you feel a part of something greater than you. Being reminded of that prompts self-reflection and personal growth. ,"I want to volunteer for Camp Kesem because I feel I'm in a space in my life where I've gotten to understand myself better and now am ready to share my experiences and empower others. After going on SPOT and opening up about my life, I realized the power of sharing. And how by sharing first, you draw others out of their shells to share reciprocatively. Nothing is more valuable than a support network, and I myself am working towards being able to ask for help, to ask for support but equally importantly, be there for others. I understand how precious a safe space where kids can share and heal from their losses is and would really love to be a counselor so that I can help protect that space. 
",,"This is a portion of a poem that I wrote while backpacking for the first time with SCA: 

Mosquitoes dance in the light of the fire, 
In the true darkness of nature, we sit.
Circled up, we share the silence when words are not needed
And whispers of comfort when they are. 

We would fall asleep to the lulling crash of the waves, 
We would stay up late to look at the Milky Way.
We’ve grown out of the molds we came in, 
We’ve melted together; we treat each other like kin.

The sunsets: breathtaking. 
The sunrise: our alarm for waking. 
These ten strangers, friends in the making. 
When this ends there’s no faking, our hearts will be aching.

During class I helped students solve math problems, taught lessons, and encouraged positive mindsets. After class I helped students who were falling behind understand the material. My income has gone to a young boy named Donald from Burkina Faso all four years, so he can attend school and have basic necessities. In letters that we write to each other, he often tells me about his wishes to become a teacher. His greater sense of purpose to help impoverished communities was a constant remainder for me to never take opportunities and education for granted and to give back to my community.  

During the past summer I volunteered as a Sunday school counselor at my local church. I taught lessons on the bible and on values such as helping others and empathy. I was blown away by how big and kind their hearts were and how full of wonder and hope their eyes were. We danced around, made paper airplanes, and sang songs--it was always such a happy time. One of the best feelings I’ve ever felt was when the parent of one girl came to pick her up and she wouldn’t let go of my leg. I love children! They give me so much joy.  
","Last summer I worked at an art camp that I went to during my highschool summers. I helped students draw and paint while managing a dorm of 10 girls who were out-of-state or international. The first summer I spent at camp was really scary and lonely at first. I felt like my parents basically shipped me to the middle of nowhere in New Jersey (I’m from Toronto) and left me there in a dorm of people I didn’t know. I remember feeling really discouraged waking up to empty canvases and people who were way more talented.

So when I wasn’t at the studio teaching, I spent a lot of time just talking to the girls and making sure they were holding up okay and since a lot of them never cooked before I would make them meals so they wouldn’t be too homesick. One part I thought I would dread but actually loved was cleaning the dorm up with pump up music. At the studio, I mostly helped my students put art portfolios for college together by fixing their artwork or giving them ideas of what to draw next! 
","1. At my highschool, the bathroom is a place of free expression.
Scrawled hastily on stall doors are raw thoughts, some inspirational, others emotional. It’s easy to mutter “thank you” to messages that read “you are beautiful” or “I believe in you.” But it is hard to look at messages that read “I’m fat and I want to die.”
Scribbling encouraging messages under anything self-deprecating wasn’t enough to reach out to those who are feeling down so I began to write for my school’s newspaper. I wrote articles on seasonal depression, body image, and finding professional help. 
My articles initiated open conversations on these previously stigmatized topics. Consequently, vulnerable students have come to realize that there is an abundance of people longing to support them. Watching my peers utilize the mental health resources published in the school newspaper made me really happy. 

2. Recently I’ve been visiting a patient by the name Nancy at Toronto Western Hospital as a patient visitor volunteer. Every Tuesday afternoon for the past year, I’d draw pictures of her favorite memories: her with a head of soft curls, her piggybacking her two sons, her playing with her sister. The nurses often neglect Nancy because her fading memories forms knots of frustration she untangles with anger. She has been at the hospital for hundreds of days without any family visitors so to watch a smile replace her aggravation as we talk and draw makes our friendship so meaningful to me. 

3. For the past two years I’ve volunteered at Out of the Cold, this emergency program that provides the homeless with a warm meal. I would make meals with a team of the kindest souls ever, wash the dishes, and ask the guests how their week has been and if there’s anything heavy on their hearts they would like to talk about. 
",My favourite childhood memories are definitely made of the nights that I’ve spent at overnight camp. This one night we played camp-wide capture the flag and then cuddled around a camp-fire by the lake to share stories and watch our counselors act out skits. My crush then held my hand and I got major stomach butterflies. ,"1. I’ve got this goal to just help people, but I have no clue how. I don’t even know if should help homeless youth, women who are trafficked, those in prison, or children in third world countries. I’m an idealist so hopefully I can help all of the above. I love people and I love listening to their stories. 

2. I’m currently dealing with how daunting it is to be a small fish in a huge pond. I’m, however, realizing that everyone is made uniquely, so there is no point in comparing ourselves to others. We’re all decided for something amazing, we’ve all got exciting paths to embark on. I’m learning that sometimes I will be ahead, and sometimes I will be behind, but in the end, the race is with myself. 

3. I gave myself a stick and poke tattoo in grade 10. I'm probably too curious for my own good. 
","I love art. I’ve loved drawing and painting for as long as I can remember. When I was little, art was about expression and sharing stories that my imagination wildly spun. Through art I’ve been able to speak up and serve in my community. I. Love. Art. 

I also love nature and going on adventurous so it would be awesome if I can be a part of that station!! Trees make me so excited, happy, and at peace. 
","My life’s most difficult times have been weathered over tissue boxes and comfort food with a community of amazing people. They have imparted advice but most importantly, their presence have imparted strength. Because of their example, I strive to embrace others – friends and strangers alike – with the same care that I have received so they may have someone to lean on during life’s most difficult times. 

In highschool my group of friends went through a lot. Their families were really broken – my friend’s mother passed away before highschool began, my other friend’s father often lost himself in his habits and subjected her to abuse. Because of this they really looked in the wrong places for love and comfort and I absolutely hated watching them slip. I felt really powerless because embracing them with love didn’t solve any of their problems. However, I believe if they had a community behind them that can impart strength and pour love on them they would have more to lean on when life gets difficult. 

None of my friends deserved what they had to go through and nor do the campers at Kesem. It just makes me really sad that they have to battle so much so I really want to be a part of what they can lean on. The friendships I’ve made at overnight camp have stayed with me till this day and bring me tremendous peace and I would love for everyone to develop the same meaningful connections.

My role was mainly to guide and mentor these kids in understanding how they could pursue a career in science and medicine in spite of the hardships placed upon them by their socioeconomic status and race. While my role may have put me in a position of power, I have no doubt that these teens taught me more than I could have ever taught them. Their experiences, ranging from seeing gang violence firsthand to parental incarceration, as compared to how they carried themselves, was admirable. The world has thrown them challenge after challenge, but they still have managed to grow from the hardship. By working with these teens I’ve gained a better sense of my own privilege. I’ve gained a better sense of how to deal with loss and adversity. But mostly, I’ve learned about how to be more empathetic. 

On another note, looking further back into my life, I was a part of my high school’s student body organization. OLP focuses on collaboration and leadership building. Since being in college, I’ve managed to continuously compile the skills I’ve acquired in order to share them with the developing leaders of my old school’s community. I’ve led leadership workshops, team building exercises, and community building efforts in order to foster a greater passion for leadership amongst the old students of my alma mater.

","When I was younger, we couldn’t afford a baby sitter to watch me. Instead, my parents brought me to our family bakery before school, and I would stay there after school until closing time. In the early mornings I slept on flour bags and went to school with flour stains all over me. After school, I was always promised we would go home earlier if I helped out in any way I could. For the most part this always meant being the cashier (bear in mind this was at the ripe and early age of 9 – I will never understand how my parents trusted me with money). While my childhood consisted of working in the bakery, there was a moment that I would never forget: baking my first pie.
	Seeing that I was getting tired of being a simple cashier, my dad taught me the secret to his sought-after pumpkin pies. We started with the crust, then worked our way to the mixture: pumpkin filling, sugar, vanilla extract, and a couple other ingredients I can never remember. Normally baked until it becomes a beautiful brown-ish orange-ish color, my first pie was burnt. My dad ate the whole thing even though I was a little repulsed by the crispiness. 
	 That day I learned to appreciate the work my dad put into that bakery and saw how much he cared about me. I once dreaded that bakery. But that day it became more of a home than my regular home.
","I am an Avatar the Last Airbender aficionado. My dream is to be a writer for my own tv show. And lastly, I broke my arm when I was younger pretending to be a superhero. While these three facts about myself are quite random, they’re three facts that capture a lot about who I am.
Avatar the Last Airbender: The show’s complex story line and fantastic character development have always kept me engaged as a kid and even now as an adult in college. My obsession highlights the inner child in me that will never leave. All the elements of this kid show – playfulness, hope, and the blind belief that happy endings exist – remind me that being “childish” is not always a bad thing if it means having fun, being happy, and being hopeful.
Screen writer: TV has always been a big influence on my life, and when looking at it, it’s because of the power shows wield over audiences. It’s important to share stories that not only entertain, but teach, empower, and validate those who watch the stories you create. Screenwriting would give me the chance to create stories that unify people.
Broken arm: superheroes, while fiction, have manifested in different ways all throughout my life. They are the teachers that believed in me when I could not believe in myself, down to my parents who have given me nothing but the world. I aspire to be someone’s superhero, no matter what form that takes.
","Birthdays, graduations, anniversaries – whatever the occasion, leis are a physical manifestation of Hawaiian culture. Giving leis has been a way for me to celebrate life’s little things. It has given me the chance to honor those who’ve come before me. Mostly, it has been a way for me to show my love. At camp, the art of lei making is something everyone can do. Candy, flower, and ribbon– whatever the material, leis are crafts that can turn into gifts and tokens of appreciation. Teaching this would help me pass on the aloha spirit to the kids that need it.","One of my biggest fears while in college is losing a family member while I’m away from home. I never really thought about this until the North Korean missile scare that happened just last year. Nothing hurt more than thinking I nearly lost my entire home – the people, the places, the memories that shaped everything I am today. Thankfully, that all was a false alarm. This year, however, that fear became a reality. In October, I lost my aunt to breast cancer.

The most difficult thing wasn’t being home for her funeral or trying to go on without her. Rather, it was having to watch her young kids grapple with her loss. In a way, losing their mother was like the missile scare – these kids lost their hero, their caregiver, the person who taught them almost everything they knew about the world. 

As a volunteer at Kesem, I want to be a part of a community that gives kids, like my cousins, the chance to explore themselves outside the realm of cancer and remember who they were (or find who they could be) in a cancer free world. I myself have a lot to learn, and as a counselor I hope the experience would be a two-way street of learning, loving, and vulnerability. Cancer is the missile scare for these kids, and while I can’t even begin to imagine how disruptive it might be to their lives, I can imagine how impactful and important this community can be.
","Because Kesem is a safe and vulnerable space, I personally feel it would be wrong for me to ask this of the campers without doing so myself. Being vulnerable is a two-way street.
First, I strongly identify with my cultural identity of being a Filipino-American. As an overlooked Southeast Asian sub-race, I think it’s especially important for me to embrace my culture and race loudly and unapologetically. Second of all, I also identify strongly with being a gay man. This may arguably be the most difficult thing I have had to grapple with, as it has conflicted with many of my familial and cultural values that I learned while growing up. One thing that never really manifested until college was the fact that I am low-income. Coming to Stanford, I began to notice how money placed me at a disadvantage in more ways than one, whether that was the social groups I was a part of or how I was perceived in others’ eyes.
All of these identities intersect to shape who I am. It is the combination of these experiences rather than the separation of these identities that give me the chance to contribute to the diversity of a community while also serving as a beacon of visibility and inspiration for students. These kids are more than just victims of cancer, and I want them to know that their struggles outside of the disease are also valid and welcomed at a camp such as Kesem.

Over the course of ten days, my friends and I were challenged to reflect on our values, how we can utilize our current skill set, and what skills we want to attain as we move forward. Simultaneously, we explored the Minnesotan wilderness and played a myriad of games. Over the course of these years, I faced many of my insecurities and developed into a more confident and enthusiastic individual. I credit the ten days I spent at my leadership camp with challenging me to both celebrate my successes and look forward to continual improvement. While I do not have outdoor leadership experience, I believe that my personal experience in a camp focused on leadership and team-building showed me the benefit of these opportunities.

",,"Twain: This year I am a Frosh RA in Twain. Being a Frosh RA has taught me how to find compromise, handle many difficult life situations, and adapt to all types of situations. Above all, this experience continues to demonstrate to me the importance of supporting my peers in both their successes and their struggles.

Class Presidents: For both my sophomore and junior year I have served as a class president. This experience is one I choose to commit time to because of the people - my co-presidents create an environment in which we can laugh, work, and move forward as a team. The experiences I’ve had with both my co-presidents and cabinet exhibit how to fulfill a role in its maximum capacity while still creating an environment that makes every day exciting and fun.

Gaieties: Despite having no theater experience, I decided my frosh year to audition for Gaieties. After being a member of the cast that year, I worked as an assistant producer my sophomore year. Gaieties is a truly one-of-a-kind community that taught me how take myself less seriously and enjoy the moment. For this, it will always be a meaningful part of my Stanford career and my young adulthood.","As a child, I spent most of my time during the weekdays following my grandfather in his garden. My grandfather double as my biggest role model and as an agronomist, so he was particularly intense about our treatment of the plants. He knew everything from how much nitrogen the soil needed to which plants needed to be rotated in next season. 
	Above all else, our time gardening brought a level of happiness to my grandfather I did not see anywhere else. He took pride in our work and the produce that resulted from it. However, one year a particularly strong storm came into our hometown right before harvest. Following the storm, my grandfather and I went out to find our entire produce destroyed. I, the six-ish year old boy who was completely useless while working in the garden, burst into tears. Meanwhile, my grandfather comforted me, explaining that one failed season did not mean our efforts were wasted.
	I tell this story because my grandfather and I often laugh about it now, as he was the literal “calm after the storm” and I was perhaps the opposite - I ended up being inconsolable for a few days, picking at smashed tomatoes as if I could revive them. My grandfather taught me how to handle a disappointing experience, even one he felt extremely passionate about, with perspective, grace, and calmness. Most importantly, the times I shared with him in his garden remain my favorite childhood memories.
","1.) I spent this past summer in Australia, just down the street from where my grandfather grew up. I share this because connecting with my family history was an incredibly important journey for me and one that has shaped my approach to junior year.
2.) I have a somewhat crazy amount of freckles that will be great for campers that want to play Connect the Dots.
3.) I have once gone an entire day just eating the cream cheese croissants from CoHo because when I commit, I commit.
","I would be most excited to lead some adventure into nature or a hike. I personally find that taking time to enjoy the beauty of the world puts my mind at ease and reminds me of all I have to be grateful for. Although hikes are not necessarily the most elaborate or intense activities, I believe their emotional return is high. Therefore, I would really enjoy taking this opportunity to bring kids into nature and let them experience both its excitement and tranquility for themselves.","I will discuss both (1) what I hope to contribute to camp and (2) what I hope to get from camp.
(1) Over the past 2+ years at Stanford, I have often showcased my more enthusiastic and eccentric personality. This time has also been one of great reflection for me, as I entered an environment completely uncomfortable to me. Over time, I have learned to embrace this discomfort. Based off my conversations with Kesem counselors, Kesem also brings out this intersection of emotions/experiences: excitement, reflection, challenge, adaptation. I believe I can appropriately handle the myriad of mindsets that campers have during their time at camp, and I look forward to helping them create bonds and positive experience while understanding the hardships that have brought them together.
(2) Secondly, what I hope to get from camp: I have found that my Stanford experience can occasionally feel rather selfish. While many of the challenges I face allow for me to grow, they can also lack intention or clear purpose. Thus, I chose to apply to Kesem for the opportunity to be challenged while working with children who have already endured enough challenges. 

In conclusion, I firmly believe that this work matters. I am excited to contribute to an organization that is making an impact through both their small and large actions. Above all else, I hope to grow, laugh, and learn alongside the campers.
","As a North Dakota native, I often joke about my odd background and the eighteen years of my life in a place that starkly contrasts with Stanford. However, I have found that my experiences in my home state allow me to connect to individuals of other odd, less common backgrounds. While I am willing to bet we will not be seeing any North Dakotans at camp, I am certain that I can bring a unique upbringing and set of experiences as a counselor at camp.",https://imgur.com/0LEvFf6, (https://hillelatstanford.wufoo.com/cabinet/enlrZWg3azE3amFrMmk=/evgP9q6nGbM%3D/),William Kenney,12/6/18, (https://hillelatstanford.wufoo.com/cabinet/enlrZWg3azE3amFrMmk=/evgP9q6nGbM%3D/),William Kenney,12/6/18,12/6/18 19:15,public,12/6/18 23:47,public,128.12.254.132,6,1

Everytime I would bring up the idea of camping, my mom would argue against the logics of why anyone would sleep on the ground when they had a cozy bed. My dad would just use his terrible insomnia to get out of the conversation. So, my first real outdoorsy experience happened when I was fourteen years old. My cousins and I backpacked through the mossy woods until we reached a bubbling stream. Each step brought me deeper into a new adventure. After a day of hiking, we set up camp that night. The cooked sausages and potatoes we made was the most delicious meal I’ve ever had. We also decided to skinny dip in the water. I had never felt so free in my entire life. After that whole experience, I was hooked. I tried canoeing, snowboarding, and even rock climbing. Through OLP, I hope to share my love for the outdoors and help teens find their own freedom in nature.

Description: I taught middle school kids who were unable to afford lessons violin and music theory every week. Some of the students had some learning disabilities such as autism. 
Role: Volunteer Performer
Date: 2017-2018
Description: I played concerts with friends at the family center. We had an interactive session at the end which allowed the students to learn about each instrument and play.
","Role: JUMP Music Camp Counselor
Date: Summer 2017
Description: As a camp counselor, I worked with groups of inner city children aged 4-12 whose schools were affected by budget cuts to musical education. I scheduled interactive music lessons and fun games for the children. My friends and I also performed during lunches. This camp ran from 9 am to mid afternoon every weekday. ","Role: Buskers Club Co-President
Date: Active 2014-18
Description:  As the Co-President, I led student run activities and meetings with a dedicated group of club officers. Our team aimed to connect high school students to various performance opportunities in our area. We performed charity concerts at nursing homes, churchs, music festivals, and hospitals.
Role: Team Leader for TEAMS Engineering Competition
Date: 2017-2018
Description: Through TEAMS, I was able to work with a group of highly passionate individuals and design solutions to problems that affected our own communities. I was involved in facilitating group meetings and kept tabs on the other 7 team members. I loved being able to rally my team and encourage people to work on something meaningful.
Role: Buddy in the Clayton High School Arts Fair
Date: One day in April every year throughout high school
Description: Every year my high school transforms the high school classrooms with different activities and puts on multiple performances based on a theme (Frozen, etc) for children with disabilities. We host multiple schools of children and have buddies accompany them throughout the day. I would help set up the rooms and also put on performances with the Buskers Club. In addition, I was a buddy for students.
","It was another summer at my cousins’ house. Ten-year-old me was not happy. All my cousins seemed to do was watch TV and play video games. I despised staying locked up in the small house. Summers were for adventures and not for screens. Consumed by frustration, I scoured the closets for items that could help my mission. I even found sleeping bags and random pots. It was decided; we were going to camp in the backyard. My cousins grab the bikes and we go to the nearest Safeway. I fill the grocery cart with ramen, hot dogs, and beans. We bring our loot back to the backyard and find wood for the fire. The whole thing felt like a fun scavenger hunt. We huddled around the fire proud of our accomplishment. I saw excitement flicker in my cousins’ eyes. We cooked the ramen in bean cans on the fire and roasted our hot dogs. We stuffed into the sleeping bags after telling our deepest secrets. We lay like lazy caterpillars and gazed at the night sky. I remember sleeping filled with content. I woke up to the chirping birds and sunlight caressing my face. I lay silently absorbing the perfect moment. My parents looked at the pile of humans with confusion, but regardless we continued our nightly ritual for a week. It was the most amazing summer without a care in the world.
","I am a firecracker: a spontaneous burst of light.  I radiate energy in the hopes some of it will infect others. I love being a positive influence on someone’s mood because some days can be really tough. In addition, I feed off of others’ energy. I love watching the people around me enjoy themselves. It ends up being a huge positive feedback loop.  I especially love working with kids as they have an infinite store of energy and a different perspective on their surroundings. 
I am empathetic and sometimes too much so. I am able to relate deeply to people’s situations and feel easily moved. (This is sometimes very annoying while watching movies.) I love being able to connect with others and have positive interactions. 
I am persistent. I grew up believing that mostly hard work and a sprinkle of good luck can help you achieve anything thanks to my mom and dad. However, this advice ended up backfiring on them when I wanted a dog. My mother did not like animals. As the scheming child that I was, I targeted my unknowing father. I would slip long letters underneath his door filled with research on how pets helped people to live longer. My conquest did not stop there. At family dinners, I cornered my father with presentations. Finally, my parents cracked and gave me a puppy. The whole ordeal was a win-win situation as I got what I wanted and my parents could have peace in the household.
","I would love to implement some of my musical expertise into the camp programming. I would enjoy leading campfire musical jams. It would also be neat to teach some of the campers how to make their own songs with simple chords on the ukulele or guitar. I think we could also have an activity where we would make our own musical instruments with materials we find in nature. In addition, I would like to help with outdoors education classes. It would be cool to learn more about the plants and species in California and share that knowledge with the kids.
","Whenever I think of my childhood, I think of an insane roller coaster of emotions. I have a lot of fond memories from that time. However, it is definitely not an easy journey. When you throw an illness into the mix, everything is much harder. Everytime I visited my aunt who was diagnosed with breast cancer, I wondered why her vitality slowly slipped away. Little ten-year-old me did not comprehend the pains that she was going through. When she passed a few years later, I felt numb and confused. Through Camp Kesem, I want to help cancer affected kids find a respite from their everyday lives and immerse themselves in a caring community. I believe the camp serves as a way for kids who are faced with a more turbulent road ahead of them a chance to enjoy being carefree kids again.  I also think the magic in the camp lies within its uniqueness and how the volunteer staff is truly committed in making the camp a positive experience for the kids. Through Camp Kesem, I want to learn from the amazing staff and also the campers.  I hope to use my experiences working in Camp Kesem to become a better student and person.",,"Inspiration for video:
I love this song as I think it represents how love can lead to some amazing things. Through Camp Kesem, I hope the loving community can be a launching pad for kids to grow and just have a fun time!

There is something about the early high school years that are so formative, and I would love to make an impact in that window. I think it would be so much fun to get to know them in an outdoor setting, away from all of the drama and business, and to give them space to think about their lives as they start their journey into adulthood. It really is the 15-16 year old age group where life starts to get real, and that can be scary or exciting depending on how you frame it, probably a little of both. Basically, I want to be a resource and a guide (pun intended) to these kids, because I know I needed one at that time.","Role: Assistant Director at Brentwood School

Role: Listener at TEENLINE
Dates: September 2013 - June 2016
Description: TEENLINE is a teen to teen crisis hotline. I would answered phone calls about anything from family problems to active suicide threats. All of the calls were from kids in high school, and unfortunately many were even younger.","Role: Leadership Member and Drama Teacher at Camp Harmony 
Dates: August 2013 - present (started summer after freshman year of high school)
Description: Camp Harmony is a camp for underprivileged children in the Los Angeles area. They have two week long camp sessions, one in the summer and one in the winter. In high school, I was a counselor at the camps and on leadership, which meant fundraising during the year. After high school, I started to run the Drama program during the summer session. ","I am currently an RA in the freshman dorm, Burbank. It has been such an incredible experience to create a community and see the impact that one person can have at such a huge transition period. It has also been such a learning experience, and has really tested my skills as a leader and organizer of everything from creating dorm norms to organizing dorm events.

I was the director and choreographer for Ram's Head Theatrical Society's Spring Musical, Chicago. That was such a mind blowing opportunity. Since it is a student group, I didn't have any faculty oversight, so everything came down to my own decisions and I had never directed anything before. I learned so much so quickly and was in charge of organizing over 100 to come together and make my vision a reality. It turned out better than I could have ever dreamed, and we performed to more than a thousand people for two weekends. 

I am also a member of the Stanford Mendicants, an all male a capella group, and last year I was our show manager and choreographer. That meant that I had to organize everyone and book the space, lead rehearsals, work with our writing team, and perform myself. It was a wild experience to try and manage 19 guys as we performed all across California, and then on our trip to Hong Kong. I had such a fun time.","I remember a time when my whole family finally got it together to take a ski trip. We were sitting inside the house and we decided to play a game. I don't know what it's called, but it entails writing a name of a person/character on a piece of paper, putting it in a hat, and then going around trying to guess who wrote which name. Some background: My brothers are ten years older than me and one of them studied comparative literature in Russian.  Anyway, I immediately know what I'm going to write as my person. No one will ever think I know the name of a famous Russian writer. I even remember how proudly I was sitting right before the name I had written was fished out. My brother read it: ""Tolstoyevsky"" I had made a couple name for Tolstoy and Dostoevsky. Needless to say, I did not win that round. But my family and I still laugh about it to this day.","I am obsessed with dachshunds. My whole family is. We almost got matching dog tattoos...

My middle name was changed to Zeus as a surprise to me. I found out during my high school graduation when they called me to the stage as Gabriel ""Zeus"" Wieder. My parents let my brothers give me my middle name when I was born. They chose Zeus originally and my parents said no, so they named me Martin after their friend. Then when I was around 10, my parents told me that story, and I begged them to change it to Zeus. I was really into Greek mythology at the time (still am honestly). Anyway, fast foreward 8 years, and somehow my parents had stored that memory somewhere, and when I walked off the podium, there they were with a stack of papers. What kind of parents change their child's LEGAL name as a SURPRISE?

I love performing. Honestly, give me a mic and a spotlight and I will entertain just about anyone. It works on kids, grandparents, dogs, even telemarketers (they love it). Unfortunately, I don't currently have the capability to offer my extremely useful services online, so I guess you'll just have to meet me and find out! ","If it wasn't already abundantly clear, I would love to do some sort of Drama program. I could also teach a dance class. I could also do a singing/songwriting activity or an improv activity. I just love performing so most of my skills are tied to theater games and warm-ups etc. which go over great with any group of kids. Also, I am a product design major, and love working with my hands and have gotten really great at arts and crafts over the years. I have quite a few cool projects in mind that I could teach.","There are so many reasons that it's hard to choose just one. First, and foremost, I want to be there for the kids. Everyone wants to make a difference in the world. The reason I do community service with kids is because it's one of the only times where I can actually feel that happen, to whatever small degree that might be. Second, I want to get to know the other counselors as well. From the outside, the Kesem community seems so incredible and packed with wonderful, interesting people. Who doesn't want to spend time with people who use their free time to help others? My brother and a few family members and friends have done Kesem, and they all only have wonderful things to say. Finally, it honestly just sounds like a ton of fun! I love being a camp counselor, and I love working with kids. I usually volunteer at Camp Harmony, a camp for underprivileged children in LA, but the fires burned down our campsite. We've been trying to find another place to hold camp, but it probably won't be the same week, as it was and that means I won't be able to go. So I am in dire need of some camp time!  ","I am gay and I'm Jewish. Those are probably the two groups to which I identify most, and I think that informs my character quite a bit. I also think that both groups are surprisingly small for how big of an impact they can have, so representation is always important.

I do have another subject to talk about here, and it's actually another big reason why I want to do Camp Kesem. This past summer, I was diagnosed with an Arteriovenous Malformation. It's basically a tumor in my brain made out of veins. After being on the table for brain surgery, having the surgery stopped, and then going through rounds of brain radiation, I can honestly say that it has been such a growing experience. Most people would assume I'd be scared or worried or sad, and sure I can feel that sometimes, but by fare the most overwhelming feeling I've had through this whole process is how grateful I am. How grateful I am to my family, my friends, my support systems of people who are with me throughout this process. With that, I can think of no better way to repay that debt than to pass it forward and do something like Camp Kesem.","Here is a link to an angiogram of my brain AVM. I think it looks pretty awesome the way it is.

The relationships I have made and the skills I have developed as a runner have been invaluable. I have also given talks to organizations (Girls on the Run) and schools (St. Raymonds, Northgate high school XC) about running and leading healthy lifestyles.
","I know not everything has to be related to camp, but this favorite memory is really about camp, I swear! 

When I first went to overnight camp the summer before 6th grade, I was very nervous. I was a huge tom boy, always wearing a backwards hat and my dad's oversized Salty Dog sweatshirt. I had always been a confident kid, but more in the ""I play sports"" kind of confident. I had all these things that I thought made me who I was, but I hadn't truly developed a strong sense of self.

One of the biggest thrills at camp is lipsync night. It is a night where all the different bunks showcase a song and dance they have been creating for the past couple of days. Our bunk's lipsync song was Had A Bad Day by none other than Alvin and the Chipmunks. Our dance had this one funky move that we did when the lyrics were ""you're taking one down"". When I did this dance, it became a fan favorite and during the performance I felt invigorated by the crowd cheering me on. I really started to feel natural and excited on stage, something I had never really experienced before. When our bunk won first place, we were ecstatic.

As cheesy as it sounds, this experience really helped me develop confidence and realize all the things I could do. I think camp can do that to a person.","1. I am goofy- I like to make jokes and embarrass myself all the time. I am not afraid to ever be myself.
2. I am dedicated- whatever I do, I like to do it the best I can. This is something that has helped me through school, running, and working with kids. 
3. I am loving- I thrive when I have the ability to create bonds with other people. I look for the good in everyone and try to be the best hype-woman I can be.","Oh boy, so many things! I have taught sports at camp before and I specifically like organizing relays (whether they be silly or running-based). I am also lowkey interested in drama and improv, which are two things I did at camp and in high school, but I haven't brought out at Stanford yet. I like making up dances/flash mobs and the amount of rally gear/costumes I have is excessive.","Simply put, I am a camp girl. I grew up going to day camp, overnight camp, and eventually working at summer camps. I also have a passion for engaging and interacting with children. I jump at the chance to work with kids through volunteering, tutoring, or even babysitting. I even sometimes get in trouble when I am at practice and my coach brings his kids because I always want to stop what I'm doing and ask about what they are learning in school, or if they did anything exciting over the weekend. In the past few years it has become clear to me that I want to work with kids in the present and in the future. While I have never worked at Camp Kesem and am on the older side, I feel like my experience and love of working with children is my biggest asset. I have never been personally affected by cancer, but I know how impactful a camp experience can be to any kid and I want to help make that possible.","I have experience working with children with special needs. I don't know how many kids at Kesem fall under this category, but it is something I am familiar and comfortable with. I also know some basic sign language if there are any deaf or hard-of-hearing campers.","I tried to recreate the infamous lipsync Had A Bad Day by Alvin and the Chipmunks so I could re-live my glory. Enjoy. feat my roommate working.

Description: I have been a confidential support system and resource for members of the sorority with anything in regards to sexual or relationship violence. I have connected Tridelt with Title IX and have created events for Tridelt members where they can individually ask questions to Title IX staffers on the process of going through a sexual assault case. Providing confidential support has been crucial to certain conversations that were had with members of the sorority, and I also am a source for helping members figure out how to move forward with their cases (e.g. go to Title IX office with them, help them use Calypso, etc). 

","When the seventh Harry Potter book came out, my father and I made the decision that we would wait in line for hours in order to get a first edition copy right at midnight. Harry Potter was a series that we both were obsessed with, and my father used to read the series to me every night before I went to bed. We were able to forget about the hardships we were facing and delve ourselves into the magical universe of Hogwarts, and that was truly special. 

That night, we went back to our hotel room at 2am and decided that we would order one large pizza, pull an all nighter, and read the whole thing together. This, of course, was not the most responsible of decisions my father has made, but it probably was the best. We stayed up until we had to walk downstairs to grab some french toast at 8am, and we had completed 600 pages of reading. By the end, we found ourselves still fully awake and gushing over the plot, characters, and ending, as well as grieving over the fact that the series was finally complete. It felt like an end to a tradition we had, but the fun we were able to maintain and the connection it provided is timeless. We just cared about being nerds, being the father-daughter pair that we were, and just doing what we love. ","I love taking care of people more than anything else in the world. My friends have me saved as mom on their phones because I tend to want to be the responsible and doting figure in their lives. I love the feeling of supporting people and listening to them, and having them rely on me, and it's so rewarding to see people I love grow and mature! 

My dream job has always been teaching. The best part of my day is being able to talk to others about things I love and seeing the spark in their eyes when they ""get it"" and we excitedly delve into deep conversations. I want to be a stepping stone for people to engage with literature, and I want to help them fall in love with it as much as I do. 

I love to cook! I have always cooked for my family (so hit me up for that Kbbq), and I find that cooking/baking calms me down. It brings me so much joy when I see people I love sit down and enjoy my food, and be able to warm and fill themselves up with a hearty meal after a long day. Talking about everyone's day at dinner and munching on some homecooked food is honestly one of the most habitual and fulfilling parts of my day, and I adore being able to provide for others in such a visceral way. It also helps that I love to eat as well. ","I would love to be able to teach a writing class or facilitate some sort of reading activity! Writing is everything to me, and one of my greatest joys in life is being able to share my passion with others. I want to create a space where campers feel free to say whatever they want to say and let go of anything that is weighing their minds down. 
 I want to provide a space where these kids can feel like they can be heroes of any story that are given or they write. 
","My father contracted stomach cancer when I was one, and though he luckily survived, I still deal with the consequences every day. I think when I was a child, I was forced to accept the circumstances and approach the grief and pain with a level of distance. I took care of my father both as family and as a patient who needed constant attention: constantly maintaining his diet and weight, ensuring he took his medication, worrying if he was in the bathroom for too long. I was not allowed nor provided a space where I could process what was going on. I didn’t even know that I wanted such a space. All I knew was that it was incredibly, excruciatingly, silently painful. 

I never want that feeling of being alone to ever occur to another child. Even though I understand that I can’t be there for every child in the universe whose lives have been touched by cancer, I feel like Kesem is an amazing place where I can start. I want to be able to support kids who went through similar situations that I did, and provide them all the love and care and fun that they deserve. Having a parent that grapples with cancer can be draining and force children to have to be more mature than their age necessitates. I want to provide a space where, even just for a week, they can simply act young, and silly, and be whatever and whoever they want to be.
","As a Korean-American, I have been grappling with cultural discrepancies all my life. One of the major roadblocks I faced was how Korean handle mental health. When I first started to reflect on childhood trauma, depression, and anxiety, I was met with a complete invalidation of my feelings from my parents, as well as a lack of mental health resources available in Seoul. The stigma surrounding mental health as being a consequence of weakness causes people to stay silent, repress their emotions, and internalize their thoughts. With this expectation, I spent years attempting to hide everything I was feeling, and tried to remain passive about things that genuinely hurt me. Now, I have learned to seek support and have moved passed these stereotypes, but this initially toxic perception of mental health was key to my understanding of how vital support, listening, and care is for every individual. 

As a counselor, I think that this could enable me to understand if campers seem unwilling to open up or are generally closed off. Moreover, I think that my growth with mental health has helped me comprehend that it can derive from things that deviate from the current situation that the individual feels is most urgent. Lastly, I think that my interactions with mental health has made me more attentive and aware of how I listen to others, and how I use my words with great care so as to ensure that they feel safe, loved, and supported. ","Writing is my life, so here's a poem! 

Portrait Sketches, c. 2018 

On my way I saw pigeons mistaking aluminum foil for breadcrumbs.
I am waiting for rainfall but I lock the door 
behind me. I am waiting for the wind to comb 
my hair but by now the blinds have been shut. 

Nature cannot remedy the oil paint 
spilled on the floor, the thrown water bottle 
now back on the ink-blotted desk. 
Papers are strewn over a pile of yesterday’s laundry, 
the dented futon rises again, leaving no evidence, 
as if to say that all has been forgiven.

I am painting a picture, just as you do at that rooftop 
studio, where we climbed despite the chill, and let 
our hands turn purple, creating violets with our frozen 
fingertips, trying to formulate love letters while reaching 
for an embrace we had not yet known.

Dates: August 2014, August 2015,  August 2016
Description: Music Madness is a nonprofit organization based in Old Tappan, NJ that teaches middle school students how to play flute and clarinet. During this three week program, we assist these students in discovering a passion for music and organize a final benefit concert wherein we collect donations that are gifted to the local school district’s music department. As president, I mostly coordinated with fellow volunteers, handled sign-ups, and overall managed logistics of the program.
 
Role: Coach’s Assistant for Spence School’s Saber’s Challenge 
Dates: September 2016 - June 2017
Description: Saber’s Challenge was an after school program for 5th and 6th grade students at the Spence School. Once a week, the program brings the team on new and unique adventures all throughout New York City, like sailing in the Hudson or rock climbing in Queens. As a coach’s assistant, I got to know the students, helped them stay together while traveling to the different locations, and assisted in many of the activities. 
","Role: English Teacher and Volleyball Coach for ACE in Vietnam, Rubenstein-Bing Student-Athlete Civic Engagement Program 
Dates: June 2018 - July 2018
Description: ACE in Vietnam, one of the summer volunteering programs offered through Stanford Athletics, was focused on tackling the issue of lack of higher education in rural parts of Vietnam. As one of the 5 students selected to participate in this three-week summer camp, I taught English lessons and volleyball to 8th and 9th graders in Long My, a rice farming village south of Ho Chi Minh City. Working with Vietnamese college students, we created our own curriculum and served as mentors for students to encourage them to find joy in school and pursue higher levels of education. 
","Role: Women’s Foil for Stanford Fencing Team
Dates: September 2017 - Present
Description: I am currently participating in my second year on the traveling team for Stanford Fencing. As a member of the Women’s Foil team, I attend weight training twice a week and fencing practice three times a week. During our season in winter quarter, we travel to four different tournaments and compete against other top-tier fencing schools in an attempt to win Western Regionals and qualify for the NCAA Championships. Last year, I ended 6th at Western Regionals and represented Stanford and USA at the Korea-USA Elite Fencing Invitational in Shanghai, China.


Role: Finance Executive for Girls Teaching Girls to Code
Dates: September 2017 - Present 
Description: Girls Teaching Girls to Code is an organization at Stanford that is dedicated to exposing more female high schoolers in the Bay Area to Computer Science. As a finance executive, I was in charge of keeping track of expenses for events and coordinating with industry leaders on sponsorships and goods. Our main priority is the annual event Code Camp in which over 200 high schoolers gather at Stanford for a day full of coding and opportunities to bond and connect with Stanford students pursuing CS. 
","My favorite childhood memory would have to be when my family drove from New Jersey to Disneyworld in Orlando, Florida. Besides the average seven year old's excitement of going to the land of childhood fantasy, I was also ecstatic about driving there in my family's brand new silver 2006 Chrysler Town and Country minivan (look up for reference- it is possibly the epitome of America's family car). My sister and I put all of the seats down, spread out blankets and pillows, brought four different Disney movies to play on the mini-tv, and packed our favorite snacks for this adventure. After traveling 1,107 miles, spending 2 nights in random rest stops, and watching ""Brother Bear"" Sing-Along version 6 (yes, you read that right. SIX.) times, we finally arrived in Orlando, excited for not only the amusement park but also having to do the long, wholesome drive back again. Well, maybe not for my parents. ","1.) I have a 3-year-old miniature Goldendoodle named Mocha. Mocha ~used to be~ chocolate brown but suddenly turned blonde. Now, the name is sort of ironic. What's also ironic is that my parents lied to me for 16 years that they were allergic to dogs until I received a photo from a friend of my dad holding her dog. The next month, we got Mocha. Funny enough, I am Mocha's least favorite person in the family.

2.) Currently, the first task on my bucket list is a cross-country road trip from New Jersey to Stanford. I hope to drive down the east coast, through Texas, and up the west coast. Ideally, I'll see friends from different states along the way, sing all 3 High School Musical soundtracks an excessive number of times, and try iconic food stops in every state. 

3.) I love music and songs invoke strong emotions - good and bad - and bring me back to specific memories. ""Congratulations"" by Post Malone reminds me of my best friend and I walking out of our high school's final all-school assembly of senior year. ""Lay It On Me"" by Vance Joy brings me back to when I found out my best friend was leaving Stanford. ""Summer on You"" by Prettymuch puts me right back in the back seat of the bus in Vietnam. While so many songs are meaningful to me, I am excited to see what songs from camp will stick with me after Camp Kesem. ","I would be so excited to facilitate a logic puzzles class at camp where we give campers time to solve Sudoku, Ken Ken, or Tangrams. Logic puzzles need guidance at first, but can easily become so entertaining and addictive. I can say I have easily sat through an entire six-hour flight solely solving sudoku puzzles. I think this puzzles class could become a new hobby for many and provide loads worth of a new type of entertainment. ","I would like to volunteer at Camp Kesem because my past three summers have been dedicated to working with children and I find it hard to just let this go. Working with children has always been a passion of min and, whether I am teaching flute or using body language to relay my thoughts, every summer, I have found the close bond that I form with campers and my peers the most rewarding. In particular, during my experience in Vietnam last summer, I met a student named Quang. Slowly building a friendship with him and hearing him open up about both his struggles and aspirations was both a rewarding and humbling experience. Although I offered my skills, I ended up learning so much more. 
Personal relationships like these are meaningful to my life and have not only shaped me into who I am today but also showed me the importance of peer mentorship in allowing others to grow. Through Camp Kesem, I hope to empower campers to overcome difficulties through the support I offer them. Most importantly, I would like to form lasting relationships that will continue to equally motivate campers and me. ","The most important part of my life is my Korean American identity. However, coming to terms with this was not an easy task. Growing up in a traditional Korean household in a predominantly white suburb, I always felt like an outlier. None of my relatives lived in the United States, my Thanksgivings looked different than the ""traditional American"" type, I spoke another language on the phone, and, well, to be honest, I looked different too. I felt like I had to put on a facade and code switch between two identities. In addition, I couldn't talk about these frustrations with my family because emotions were never a topic of conversation for my family. I never felt like I was my true self until I stepped foot in my bedroom. 

However, upon moving across the country to attend a university filled with people of diverse identities and backgrounds, I met people who not only experienced the same emotions but also those who were willing to hear my thoughts and emotions. I was finally able to have the conversations I need to have to be able to embrace my own racial identity. I know that my Korean heritage is awesome and, through the change of environment, I learned that it is the people around me that allow me to be myself. This experience of mine motivates me to provide a similarly welcoming community for campers at Kesem so that they can show their true selves, be proud, and embrace happiness.","I love to doodle and color to destress and take my mind off of things. I've purchased about four paint by numbers sets since the beginning of the year and I'm still not sure if I should label it as self-care or procrastination. Either way, I made a coloring page that consists of images of Camp Kesem. I think this page not only shows my creative skills but it also depicts what Camp Kesem looks like in my mind, a strong community in which campers and counselors can have fun and learn from one another.

Time: January 2014-June 2018 
Description: I have voluntarily tutored various middle schoolers in a number of subjects. I have tutored in math, Spanish, and Latin. Tutoring has developed my abilities to explain concepts and rules in understandable terms to youth.

Role: Referee for Youth League (Under 10s)
Time: September 2016-September 2018
Description: I refereed soccer matches in my community for children under ten years old. My job was mainly to maintain discipline. If a player was misbehaving or endangering the safety of the opponents, I had to take appropriate action based on the scenario. This sometimes meant asking the player to sit out but often could be solved by a simple conversation.

Role: Lifeguard
Time: June 2017- August 2018
Description: I worked for two summers as a lifeguard, and I am certified by the American Red Cross. In addition to learning the safety and emergency response techniques, I have also gained tremendous experience working with children. As a lifeguard, it is your job to make sure children (and all patrons) are safe but also having fun. Through my experience, I have been able to find the intersection between safe and fun for many children.

Role: Boys Varsity Soccer Captain
Time: September 2014-November 2018
Description: My “high school” served grades six through twelve. As a result, there has been tremendous overlap between ages throughout my time at this school. Most importantly, during sports, in particular soccer, I constantly served as a role model for the younger players as varsity captain. When we had combined practices or other frequent interactions with the younger players, I would always go out of my way to help teach them new skills and encourage their love for the sport.

Role: Employee at Chocolate Shell Shoppe
Time: June 2018
Description: I worked at a small, local chocolate shoppe. Children of all ages would come into the shoppe every day. For many children, buying candy was their first time having any financial responsibility.  I continuously interacted with them helping to pick out candy and figure out their payments. As such, I was able to communicate with them and encourage them to use their math skills to make candy selections based on the money they had.","Role: High Hopes Therapeutic Riding Center
Time: June-July 2016
Description: I volunteered at a camp at a local therapeutic riding center. At this camp, I taught equestrian skills and horseback riding to children ages seven through fourteen with various physical and mental disabilities. The idea of the program is that riding provides confidence and a passion. Also, for those with physical disabilities that impairs walking, the movement of a horse as the rider sits on its back mimics the motion of walking.","Role: Head of Political and Social Justice Awareness Group
Time: September 2017-Present
Description: I lead discussions with club members on issues ranging from race to politics to women’s rights. I also organized events inviting guest speakers and setting up lunch discussions to promote discourse on social issues in my school community

Role: Constituent Services Intern for Congressman Joe Courtney
Time: Summer 2017
Description: Facilitated communication between Congressman and district through town halls, constituent outreach, and grant forums for local businesses

Role: Soccer
Time: Premier Team September 2014- July 2018 and Varsity (September 2015-November 2018)
Description: I was the Boys Varsity Captain for the Williams School. I served as a role model and leader for other players. I coordinated team meetings and assisted coaches in training the team. I received All-State, MVP, Coaches Award, All-SENE, and WNEPSSA All-Star. Also, I was a player for Southeast Soccer Club—#4 ranked soccer team in Connecticut.","When I first went to sleep away camp, I couldn’t stop crying; I didn’t want to leave my family. A deep pit consumed my stomach, and I could not stop crying. I remember physically clinging onto my dad’s aqua blue polo shirt, hoping with all my heart I could stop him from leaving. That first night, I barely slept. 

In the early afternoon of that day, I made my way to the field. The other campers were talking and laughing, excited to play. I stood off to the side and pretended like I was tying my shoes, waiting for the game to start.

We separated into teams, the counselor blew his whistle, and we were off. I walked around--half in the game, half at home. Then, someone passed the ball to me. I took a touch and looked down at my feet. Immediately someone tackled it away. I looked up and burst after the ball. Now, I started playing. I pirouetted around defenders, passed to my teammates, and shot the ball in the back of the net. I high-fived my teammates, I smiled and I even laughed. I stopped in my tracks and looked around the field. I realized my parents weren’t even here. Bodies of children shot around the field. I realized I was on my own. I could do all this without my parents, without my family; I could do all this by myself. I smiled and burst after the ball.
","	The first thing you should know about me is that my name is Callum. It has garnered a lot of attention throughout my life. Its origins are Scottish. Why Scottish? My parents met in Scotland by total coincidence. My father, British-born, was working there for a few months at the time. My mother, American, was speaking at a comparative medicine conference there. A mutual friend introduced them briefly, and six months later they were married. Through immigration to this country, the struggles of my father finding a job, and the trials of raising three boys, their love for each other has not wavered since. Equally, their love for me has never dipped. This is important to know because I am a product of love and support through smooth winds and choppy storms. This is fundamental in who I am because I strive to emulate their love and support for everyone I meet and everyone I know.

Second, I LOVE Liverpool FC! The red of this prodigious soccer team hailing from one of the greatest industrial cities on Earth runs through my veins.

Third, I can be loud but only when I get going. Shy at first, I don’t open up until I start to feel comfortable. Years of high school social dynamics have tempered my flame and made me think about how I am acting at all times. Since coming to Stanford, I am slowly returning to the lyric-screaming, crazy-dancing, bubbling child I was and always will be.
","I would be excited to have the opportunity to teach any subject, game, or activity at camp! The opportunity to be with children and support them is exciting in itself! That said, I would be particularly interested in teaching sports such as soccer or basketball. I have played soccer all my life, and I am also passionate about basketball. Sports are both fun and educational for campers. I would also love to facilitate arts and crafts activities. While I am not a particularly amazing artist, I enjoy arts and crafts especially if it involves and excites the campers.
","Cancer has profoundly affected my life in ways I know and ways I probably do not fully understand. My mother is a researcher who studies oncology drug safety. I have grown up hearing both amazing success stories of treatments as well devastating losses. In addition, both my grandmothers battled and successfully fought off cancer -- one breast cancer and one skin cancer. Last year, my uncle passed away after a long fight with bowel cancer. Having thought he had successfully kicked it, the cancer came back causing him and my family incredible anguish. For his children, it was as if they had just lost a battle they thought they had already won. The fight for all three of these family figures has put tremendous stress on my family. As my father is from England, the entirety of his side of the family lives across the Atlantic. Both my uncle and paternal grandmother struggled against cancer three thousand miles away from my father, me, and my nuclear family residing in Connecticut. I could feel and hear their suffering but couldn’t comfort or help out in any way but to send my thoughts and prayers. I was neither able to support those who suffered from cancer nor my family who, although healthy, suffered with them. Working at Camp Kesem would be an opportunity to bridge this distance and finally support those who are affected by cancer at their most vulnerable and formative stages of life -- youth.","On September 24th, 2016, I suffered two blows to the head—one from an elbow, one from a ball—during a soccer game. I was brought to the hospital and diagnosed with a concussion and a broken nose. I did not return to a full academic load until early December, and I did not return to soccer for seven months.

The setbacks I faced athletically and academically due to my concussion had profound effects on my emotional state. I felt constantly dejected and frustrated. Some nights I would sit in bed just thinking about everything I was missing out on—my learning as well as my soccer. Eventually, I realized that I needed to take things slowly. I had been trying to force myself to get better, to rush myself back to school and soccer. Eventually, I learned patience. When I would face a setback in the return to play process, I would reassess the situation and outline my next steps. In retrospect, I realize that I had balled up all my frustration and anger. I now see that this is something I do in many walks of life. As a result, I am working to talk things out with others to more maturely and holistically address various issues. The biggest lesson I can take away from my concussion is that you can learn from any failure, mistake, or problem. No matter how painful—physically and emotionally—my injury was, I have become more mature, more perspicacious, and more self aware.","Among the coned pines and tall oaks and along the crunchy path,
Beneath the dusted leaves and the birds’ songs,
Beside the ferns and undergrowth shrubs,
Above the dirt-packed Earth,
Among the bugs and the critters, the birds and the deer, the trees and the grass,
We walk, backpacks on back, feet on ground.
We come alone, a singular figure amidst the paths of many.
We come perhaps separate, perhaps broken, perhaps chained. 
We come tall and small, bent and straight, different and the same.
We come here.
Where cabin doors creak,
Where campfires crackle,
Where songs are sung.
And we stay. And we find place.
Centered in the crunchy paths beneath the coned pines and the tall oaks,
We find he and she who have not yet been spoken of,
We find he and she who are not yet acknowledged,
We find he and she who are not yet known,
We find he and she who is strong and mighty, who can swing through the tallest oaks,
We find he and she who is strong and mighty, but who can let tears wet the face and still hold the head high.
We find he and she who is hurt and broken, who needs to rise to the heights of the tallest oaks and conquer the crunchy paths.
We find he and she who is most important.
We find he and she who is most true.
We find he and she who is he and she.

Description: I volunteered to help with my school districts middle school band camp, serving lunch to the students over the course of the week and helping to monitor certain integrated music rhythm games and prepare for the final concert and rehearsals at the end with room set up and take down.
","Role: Marching band section leader and principal flute
Dates: August 2015-June 2018
Description: As a section leader, I impacted my band community by being a role model that the younger students had to look up to. I was responsible for teaching marching technique to the flute section and making sure playing position, musical ability, and mental endurance was up to par with what the director wanted. I also served as a sense of familiarity and comfort as middle schoolers made the hard transition to high school. As principal flute, I held outside music rehearsals and practice sessions to improve individual playing ability and extra marching practices to improve personal marching ability.

Role: Rho Kappa Society President and Vice President
Dates: September 2016- June 2018
Description: As the leader of this organization, I tried to make an impact by increasing people's awareness of the social studies and fostering an understanding of diversity and cultures. We were able to pilot a program where the society was able to provide tutoring in terms of writing document based questions for the purpose of AP history courses as well as provide fun opportunities by promoting culturally based local activities and promoting school-sponsored events such as TEDx youth.
","Home alone, me and my siblings were spiraling around, energetic from the secret stash of Halloween candy that we had found underneath the kitchen sink. My brother pulls out a wrestling WWE belt from under his bed. My sister and I slowly begin to back up and my older sister manages to escape the room while my brother traps me inside. I, fearful for my life, anticipate his diabolical plans and immediately, and imaginatively of course, conjure up a fireball to throw at him. He dodges and instead wrestles me to the ground, claiming that he was the new ultimate WWE champion. I scream and my sister runs in to help, again throwing a water ball (because of course she was a water bender at the time) to aid in my resistance against my brother. We continue to fight and run around the house doing everything from through ourselves into the dryer and just tumbling inside them to trying to fit fitted sheets over us on the bed that we all shared. This is my favorite childhood memory because of the freedom I had, the freedom to simply enjoy with my siblings until my parents got back. The freedom that was immediately destroyed when my brother entered his first year of high school and for the first time locked his room against the open passage of me and my sister. A freedom I wish I could get back as my siblings and I are apart, all struggling in college life.","I walk to all my classes instead of biking. That may seem simple and insignificant in terms of what I want you to know about me but let's unpack that sentence a little bit. I walk because the beauty of the earth is much to large for one to bike past in a frenzy. I feel my feet press into the ground with every step I take and watch the leaves float past me and hear the crunch of fallen leaves under my sandals. I think one main thing about me is my perception that there are so many beautiful instances in the world where everyone whizzing about should take a step back...and finally breathe. I want people to know that I try to seek happiness in everything that I do and everything that I see. That failed midterm? Turn it into an opportunity to do better. Rejected from an orchestra? Use it as time to find and develop other passions. One last thing about me is that I never know whether or not I am good enough or have the qualities that someone wants; however, in every situation I try to communicate that I have the capacity to intensely learn and apply that philosophy to most things that I want to hopefully accomplish in the future.","I would be so excited to teach rhythm and music related activities! Music has been such a huge part of my life ever since I joined the band program and I would be so excited to share that love and joy with kids. Games such as rhythm baseball and musical chairs and other related activities such as music learning and perhaps even basic instrumental teaching would be awesome to facilitate and maybe even transmit my love of music to the kids to take home and use as their own haven and escape.

","Last November, my mother was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer and it felt like my world was falling apart and crumbling at my feet. She kept it a secret from me until she had no choice but to tell me. I felt disconnected. I knew that there was treatment and I knew that she had an opportunity to get better but the negativity surrounded me. ""Already spread to lymph nodes."" ""Aggressive form of cancer found commonly in black women."" These words seemingly faded in and faded out of my brain. With the support of my friends nd family, I was able to pull myself up and still look forward to the better things, college decisions, and her hopefully getting better. What the people that I hold dearly did for me is what I want to do for others. There is so much love and warmth and happiness that a place like Camp Kesem can provide for others. It would be an amazing opportunity to me to be a part of that and volunteer to a cause that is aimed with dealing and internalizing the effects that cancer has on our wellbeing and individuality. Cancer is hard. Life is hard. But I think camp can be a place of great experiences to those affected by it. Who can turn down an opportunity to be a part of that?","I am the first generation of my family in America from Nigeria. My siblings and I were all born here from the hopefulness that my parents had to start a new and better life here when compared to their home. I identify as African-American and Nigerian-American. My parents gave us all English names for us to fit into society and succeed the way they wanted us to. I think within the counselor community, it is important to have counselors that identify and understand being underrepresented within society. There is huge health disparity regarding cancer in America. At times, black women are more likely to get cancer than white women yet I feel that the campers do not reflect this disparity. Perhaps the camp for some does not seem like the place where they fill their needs will be met. Perhaps some even believe that Camp Kesem is not meant for people like them. Having diversity within the counselor community is crucial to breaking down this concept. I cannot recall the amount of summer camps I never went to because I was always told by my parents that the camp was not looking for kids like me. This simply increases the alienation among individuals and makes it harder to deal with the change that cancer brings upon a family. I want to support campers in anyway I can and sometimes it’s comforting to see people that truly can understand you and see you for you.","supercalifragilisticexpialidocious

Though I worked with many younger students, I also got to help high schoolers who were given scholarships to attend the camp conduct research projects in the San Juan Islands. We were together for three weeks. I felt so lucky to learn and grow with these teens, who were in turns funny, challenging, deeply reflective, silly, and kind. 
These days, I spend most of my time engaged in the Outdoor House community on campus. I thoroughly believe that exploring the outdoors is an incredible and meaningful way to form relationships, work as a team, and learn new things with a group of people.

Role: Picture Book Author for RINEW Intervention Team in Bangladesh
Dates: September 2018-Present
Description: I have recently become involved in writing and illustrating picture books to convey health recommendations to mothers in rural Bangladesh, with the help of one Stanford PhD student and a team of community organizers at the International Center for Diarrheal Disease Research. I have just completed my first book for them and plan to continue helping. ","On the day I graduated from kindergarten, I had goldfish in my pocket. 

I was really proud of them. We had goldfish for snack that day, and I saved some in my pocket just to show my mom. I knew she was coming to get me because it was my very last day, and she had taken off work early.

It was a gorgeous June day, the kind that's much more appreciated in Washington than it is in California - everything was so green it glowed. And the playground was enormous. I swear it was miles long. I remember there was a fence that ran all along the side of the play area, where the parents would come and wait for us when recess ended. Our teacher would stand at the gate to the fence and check us out two by two as we left, like she was counting the animals getting off Noah's ark. Normally it was my nanny waiting there. But this time it was Mom. 

My friend Katie and I ran over together, and I tried to pull the goldfish out of my pocket while I ran. This act of coordination proved too great for my five-year-old body. I tripped on the bark chips. The goldfish and I both went flying. 

At the time, I was pretty upset, I think - I skinned my knee and everything. But now I mostly think about my mom, and how nice it was of her to come. ","Kindness and vulnerability are more important to me than anything. 

I have a stuffed owl named Whobert, and a stuffed saber-tooth tiger named Toast. 

And when I am feeling my absolute worst, it helps a lot if someone tells me a story. 

","At this point in my Stanford career, I have a good amount of experience helping people tell their stories through theater, creative writing, and art. I think creative forms of expression can be the best way to connect with other people. So far, I have found that everyone I've met has something extraordinary to share. 

I would love to do a miniature Flying Treehouse at camp - to help kids or teens write stories, and then work with them to make their stories come to life. ","I have heard about Kesem for years - since I began Stanford - from many communities. I don't know that I was ready for Kesem until now, though. Coming into Stanford, I had so, so much to find out about myself, and couldn't always help other people at the same time, even though I often thought I could. I was just keeping my head above water. 

Now, as a leader in some of my campus communities and as an upperclassman, I still have lots to learn, but have found myself driven over and over again by my desire to create wonder and joy for other people (even though it is often difficult). Everyone deserves to have a little magic in their lives - and everyone definitely needs a place to call home and to relax. When I have taken care of myself and have the space to do so, I find myself truly enjoying the work that comes with creating positive experiences for others, as well as listening attentively to people's reflective thoughts. 

I hope that Kesem will be fulfilling in this way, and will let me employ the things I have learned to add a bit more magic to the world. ","My mother has epilepsy. Though her seizures have little impact on her life today (she hasn't had one in years), it took her doctors a long time to figure out what was wrong, and so for a few years of my childhood she spent a lot of time in bed or at the doctor's office. I think that my experience as a child with her illness had a big impact for me, and makes me particularly empathetic towards children with parents who are ill or not around too often. 

I also struggled greatly with my own mental health earlier in my Stanford career, particularly with anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation. I was actually involuntarily hospitalized in my freshman year for a suicide attempt. That was a huge turning point for me - I have since dedicated myself to the cause of mental health in children and teens, and have collected a lot of information about what works for me and how people can be helped in similar situations. I still have a ton of room to grow, but I am proud of how much I've learned already, and I think my experience there could be valuable to the Kesem community.

Finally, I think it is important for me to recognize that I am an upper middle class, cis-female American white woman with an immense amount of privilege. I never want to forget or ignore this privilege; I think it is important to be aware of it and treat it thoughtfully. ","When I decided to apply
I sat and wrote into the night 
I did not stop to wonder why 
and finished feeling full and light

Cause Kesem seems to me to be 
A place where college kids can thrive
And more than that where kids are free - 
where everyone can feel alive. 

I do not know if I'll be picked 
I have no clue if I'll succeed
And if I'm not, I won't be ticked
I must not be what Kesem needs

The children are the key to camp
And for them we should make it great,
So if about me you're not amped,
Choose someone else - don't hesitate!

See, to me, it's more important that
This place remains a wondrous one
Than that my name is in the hat
And isn't chosen when you're done. 

But for kids I'll play, day after day, and work until I'm tired - 
And this is why I hope that I can one day soon be hired.

","A favorite childhood memory of mine, is playing with my two older brothers at home. They would tickle me, wrestle me around, and show me the brotherly love that I am always nostalgic for to this day. One day I remember in particular, in which they tickled me so much that I started crying and accidently peed my pants. As you can see, this is a memory that I easily remember. Even though I was incredibly mad and embarrassed, I look back and realize that these were my brothers showing me their love in the most exciting way possible. They made me into the person I am today, raising me to be a respectable and genuine person of society. And for that--for my brothers-- I am most appreciative. ","What are three things you want us to know about you? (Limit: 250 words) *
Humor - I live my life with a constant energy of humor. Everything that I do, whether it is meeting someone new, or dealing with a stress in my life, I constantly attempt to approach these situations with genuine humor and enthusiasm. I believe that a good laugh can make anyone’s day better, no matter how good or bad their current situation may be. 

Warmth - I strive to exhibit a personal trait of warmth to everyone that I interact with, 24/7. Whether I am tired out of my mind, or incredibly happy, I enjoy displaying a trait of warmth toward everyone that I meet. This passion spans from the fact that I strive for everyone I meet to smile. I believe a smiling face is the best face, and I strive resonate my warmth with others to make them smile. 

Genuine - I am genuine. I live my life with a constant value of authenticity that I strive to exhibit toward everything that I experience in life. I believe that living a genuine life is something that all people may appreciate, whether it is my neighbor or my best friend. I strive for everyone that I meet, and everyone that knows me in the past, to realize that the Victor that they meet for the first time, is the same Victor that they can talk to each and every time in the future.","Something that I would be excited to teach at camp is swimming and aquatic lessons. I have been swimming since I was four years old, and each and every summer I have gone to the community swimming pool to swim. Swimming is honestly my favorite hobby, and it is an activity that will always make me happy. Thus, I would LOVE to share this passion with the children at camp. I want them to enjoy swimming and playing in the water as I do, and I want them to carry this hobby far past the week long camp. ","Throughout my entire young adult and high school experience, I have identified a common resonating passion with all the extracurricular activities that I have devoted much of my time to--working with youth and children. From being a swim instructor and teaching young children how to swim, to being a private tutor for K-12 students, to working with children with disabilities in an aquatic environment, working with children has been a large part of my life in recent years. I want to volunteer my time to Camp Kesem for this very reason. I have an incredibly strong and unbound passion for children and youth development, and I believe-- I know--that working with these children who have been affected by the unfortunate--and sometimes devastating -- circumstances that come with cancer, is something that I want to devote all my time and energy to. I want to have a positive impact on these children in the best ways possible. I want to make them smile, laugh, and love living life as I do. ",,"I believe that simplicity in humor is the best way to make someone smile and laugh. A simple joke. A small twitch of the hand. A small duck. Essentially, anything small and simple. For this reason, I have compiled all of my artistic ability into this work of art. Thank you for appreciating my project.

Role: Symphonic band member @ York High School
Dates: August 2014-May 2017 (sophomore through senior year)
Description: As a clarinet player and section leader in my high school’s symphonic band, I got to create amazing music with lots of other talented students. Everyone in the band was apart of a small ensemble, and I was in a quintet of woodwind players. Our small ensembles were really great because we would pick out music ourselves, rehearse ourselves, and schedule gigs in the community. We’d often go to nursing homes to play our music, and that experience was always so incredibly rewarding.
","I sit on the sofa of the living room in my grandparents’ log cabin in Montana, wrapped in a cozy blanket, wearing fuzzy socks, a mug of hot chocolate with mini marshmallows warming my hands. My sister sits next to me, but I’m faced away from her because I know she’s going to try to cheat by looking at my cards. My parents and grandparents sit around the card table in front of me. We’re playing Five Crowns, a game that has historically torn our family apart, but for the moment, it brings us together. Flames crackle in the fireplace, and I feel its warmth on the right side of my face. I can feel myself getting tired after a long day of hiking to the waterfalls and playing with my grandparents’ dog, Teddy. There’s no service up here, but no one thinks twice about it (I don’t even miss my iPod touch). I look through the window and see more stars than ever before because of all the light pollution in Chicago. Everything in that moment is so warm. So calm. So content. That cabin is one of my favorite places ever and memories with my family like that are always cherished.","The first thing I’d want you to know about me is that I’m Mexican-American! My dad grew up in Mexico and my mom is half Mexican, so I grew up with the wonderful food, music, and importance of family that comes with being Mexican. Not being fluent in Spanish has made me question my validity as a Mexican-American, but embracing my culture and learning more about it is becoming more and more important to me since coming to Stanford. 

Secondly, I love to travel. I think it’s the coolest thing to be surrounded by such different people that, at the same time, are so similar to you. This idea has really helped me appreciate the differences in people everyday. Everyone’s life experiences are so vastly different, and yet, we are all human, and because of that, we have an obligation to be kind to one another and respect/learn from others’ experiences.

The third thing is that last spring I injured my knee playing soccer and basically ended up tearing a ton of ligaments. I had a couple surgeries for it over the summer and am currently doing physical therapy to get it back to normal. So, my point is that by the time Camp Kesem happens this summer, I may not be able to participate in some super physical activities. But that just means I can help with other stuff or do something else with other kids who can’t participate in similar activities!
","I would love to either teach kids how to make gimp keychains/bracelets or facilitate an adventurous activity. Gimp keychains/bracelets are something I learned how to make when I went to summer camp throughout middle school. I’ve found it’s a great bonding experience and allows people to make something cool and creative! I would also love to help facilitate some sort of adventurous activity like a ropes course or rock climbing. I was always an adventurous kid, so I think facilitating an activity that challenges kids in a positive way like that would be really fun and rewarding.","There are so many reasons, but these are the main ones: I want to give kids an amazing experience similar to what I had as a kid, I want to help out families affected by cancer, and volunteering is an amazing way to spread kindness to the world.

I went to summer camp for 5 years when I was kid, and the memories I made there are some of the best ones of my life. Such amazing friendships, adventures, and support found at camp are difficult to come by elsewhere. I want to take the experiences I've had as a camper and share them with other kids to hopefully create just as great memories for them.

Both of my grandmas had cancer when I was a kid, and I am fortunate enough to have them both still in my life today. I think a lot about how different my life could have been if either of them passed away, and it makes me want to help other families who aren't so lucky. Camp Kesem can allow me to have a huge positive impact on these families, so that's a huge reason why I'd love to volunteer my time.

Volunteering is one of the best ways to spread love and kindness, in my opinion. Giving your time and dedication to help others is one of the best things you can do, and I would love to spread my love and kindness through Camp Kesem.",,https://wordart.com/1p5r0ndfp7ab/word-art, (https://hillelatstanford.wufoo.com/cabinet/enlrZWg3azE3amFrMmk=/j8Mzuy7vwvU%3D/),Gabriela Uribe,12/6/18, (https://hillelatstanford.wufoo.com/cabinet/enlrZWg3azE3amFrMmk=/j8Mzuy7vwvU%3D/),Gabriela Uribe,12/6/18,12/6/18 21:01,public,12/6/18 21:25,public,128.12.255.132,6,1

Dates: 2004-Present
Description: Some of my earliest childhood memories are of going to work with my mom. She is a speech-language pathologist at a school for children with special needs, and volunteering at her office has been one of my favorite activities throughout my entire life. I have watched children transform from toddlers with little to no speech to interesting, fun, quirky, amazing tweens. I love forming meaningful relationships with children because I get to be goofy and fun and truly let out my inner child. 

Role: Rowing Coach
Dates: June-September 2018
Description: This summer, I worked as a coach for my high school club. I primarily coached private lessons one-on-one with rowers from the ages of 11-16. 

","Although I have never worked at a camp, I went to sleep-away camp in Maine for seven summers throughout my childhood. Camp was one of the most meaningful experiences of my life. My memories on Lake Thompson of waterskiing, hiking, and just hanging out with my friends are truly some of my most cherished childhood memories. Coincidentally, my first summer at camp was also the summer my father was diagnosed with brain cancer. One of the other girls in my bunk’s mom had breast cancer that summer, and it was really special for me to be able to bond with her over our shared experiences. That friend, Eliza, and all of my other friends from camp are some of my best friends to this day. 
","The main groups I have devoted my time to in recent years have been my two rowing teams. Over the past three years, I rowed for City Island Rowing, and now I am on the open weight rowing team here at Stanford. I was team captain of my high school team, and I loved the opportunity to lead the younger girls on my team on their rowing paths. I also spent my summer coaching middle schoolers in Learn-to-Row classes. I love rowing because it is the ultimate team sport. In order for a boat to be fast, everyone must be rowing in the same exact manner, and if you’re standing out, you’re the problem. Nothing feels better than when a boat just clicks and everyone is rowing together on the same page and pushing their hearts out. ","One of my favorite childhood memories is of the times spent on the Hudson River with my dad. My dad was a ship captain and later a yacht broker, so I spent large amounts of time on the water as a child. One of my favorite activities was waking up on a weekend morning and going to work with my dad. I would spend the whole day running around large ships, feeding ducks, exploring engine rooms, and pestering crew members. At the end of the day, my dad would take me on our boat to see the Statue of Liberty. These fonds memories of my childhood on the water have led me to feel deeply connected to the water for my entire life. 
",I want you to know that I am very hardworking and dedicated. I invest myself fully in everything I decide to do. I also  am a team player. I have always been an extrovert and I feel like I thrive in groups where I can work with others. I am also very energetic and enthusiastic. I am a very spirited person!,"I would be excited to teach any nature/water activities. I am very comfortable on the water, and I also love hiking and other outdoorsy/adventure activities. I would also love to help lead campfires. ","From the moment I heard of Camp Kesem, I knew I wanted to be a part of this community. My father passed away from brain cancer when I was ten years old in 2010, and I have always been interested in supporting kids who are going through the experience that I felt. When my dad had cancer, I only had one friend who even mildly understood what I was going through, and I can’t even imagine how valuable a community like Kesem would have been to me.

Dates: 5 weeks between June and August 2018 (Summer after Freshman year)
Description: I worked closely with another counselor to plan and lead activities, including outdoor games, scavenger hunts, story time, lots of arts and crafts projects, and off-site field trips. I worked with groups of 10-15 kids at a time, and also interacted with their parents and the camp directors. Most of the children I worked with were between the ages of 5 and 8, but kids of varying ages attended the camp, so I worked with older and younger children as well.

Dates: April 2018-Present (Started Frosh Spring Quarter)
Description: As a Bridge staffer I work to offer peer counseling and support to people who are struggling, in an effort to help guide them in developing their own solutions to problems or finding ways of coping with difficult times.  I am glad to doing this work and to be able to provide support and give back to the Stanford community, which has done a lot for me.

Description: As a frosh 101 leader, I helped support incoming students during their first quarter at Stanford. Every week, two other leaders and I led activities and conversations for a group of frosh, designed to support them in building community, engaging diversity, reflecting on their own identities and experiences, and more.  ","I have two younger sisters, and to this day we are pretty much inseparable. Most of my fondest memories revolve around spending time with them. I have happy memories of family vacations, of playing ""school"" with my sisters and assigning them homework, of entertaining ourselves with games of our own invention, like and rocking horse races. Most of my happiest memories are just spending time with them! ","I love art. Drawing, painting, photography, craft projects, pretty much anything! I love to express myself in creative ways through the visual arts. I find creating art to be a really peaceful and calming presence in my life, and it's something I really love! 

Growing up, I've spent a lot of time out in nature, and I love being outside. I really enjoy being out in nature, whether hiking, running, or just going for a short walk or doing my homework outside. When I'm out in nature I feel very connected to the world, which is something I really enjoy. 

I'm not always the most outgoing, but I love getting to know people. I can be a bit quiet but I try hard to reach out to those around me, and I am always here as a support resource for people around me. ","I'd love to facilitate art/ craft projects at camp. Art is really important to me, and I would love to share my passion for it with the children at camp! I helped lead art projects at the camp I worked at last summer, and I really enjoyed it. I have always found art to be an amazing means of reflection and expression, and I hope I could help others find that as well. ","I think that the work that Camp Kesem does to support children is absolutely amazing. Coping with a loved one's cancer is so difficult. My dad was diagnosed with leukemia a year and a half ago, and it's really hard and painful seeing a parent struggle in that way. I think Camp Kesem is wonderful because it not only gives children impacted by cancer a chance to have fun and enjoy camp, but it also gives them a chance to find support in what they've been through and build a lasting community. I really the think that Camp Kesem does incredible, and extremely important work, and I would love to lend my support to this amazing program and helping the campers have both a wonderful week at camp and find a lasting supportive community.

Description: I try to foster an environment that is enjoyable, while still competitive at high levels. I try to represent Stanford well as a club athlete, while also trying to make as many friendships as possible with my teammates. We support the varsity teams and use soccer as a much-needed break from the craziness of academics.

Dates: October 2016 – Present 
Description: is a cause that I worked closely with a few years ago and continue to check up on currently. Helped organize classmates to raise awareness about the water crisis in Africa. Today use the cause as a way to raise awareness about these issues, and also share some important positive aspects of Africa. This experience caused me to reflect on the amazing life I have been given and urged me to help others understand that women and children just like me struggle just to find life’s necessities.
","Every year on Martin Luther King Jr. day my dad would take me and my brother mini golfing. I was not particularly good at it ever, but my favorite childhood memories are spending time with my dad and my brother for a day. It was always cold and there was usually snow on the course which made it fun and challenging. My brother and I would compete to see who could get the lowest score. He always won, but I think these experiences instilled a sense drive and persistence in me. My dad would let us get fast food after, and no matter how bad I lost to both of them I always left smiling. I always looked forward to MLK day because it meant I got to spend time with my two favorite boys.","1. If I could road trip, camp, and travel the world without any responsibilities I totally would. My ideal life would be nomadic with minimal financial obligations. I would just have a backpack and probally sell churros on the beach somewhere.

2. I have a puppy at home named Louie who does a lot of weird things, but he is honestly my best friend. He has a lot of phobias and he acts just like a human sometimes. We really bonded and I miss him every day.

3. I have been trying (unsuccessfully) to learn how to play the ukulele and write poetry since June, but I am determined to learn one song or write one good poem by the end of the year.
","I do not know if the terrain would permit this, but I would love to teach kids about skateboarding and long boarding. I learned when I was about 8 and it allowed me to be part of a really cool culture that encourages healthy risk taking, physical activity, and resilience. Skateboarding/longboarding is about falling a lot, but getting up and trying again. I think people are scared of it, but once you learn its so much fun and you feel so free. It would be really cool to give kids a taste of being on a board.  ","I want to volunteer at Camp Kesem because I think it would be a good challenge, and an incredible way to make a few kids breathe a little easier for a week. Ive never done anything like this and that is both scary and exciting for me. I want to not only step out of my comfort zone, but also utilize this opportunity to help kids grow and cope. I want to make meaningful connections with people, while also learning about the hard experiences of kids and other members of my community. Although, I have not personally had a parent or sibling affected by cancer, I have seen the devastating affects in friends and neighbors.  I want to help in anyway that I can honestly. I love to laugh and joke around, so I want to maybe bring some fun and laughter into the lives of kids who have suffered unimaginable loss. Volunteering my time at Camp Kesem would be a transformative lesson on empathy, and hopefully a growth opportunity for me and hopefully the kids I counsel. I love the outdoors, learning new things, and laughing a lot so I think Camp Kesem would be a great place to do all three of those things.
","I identify as a queer, multi-racial black woman. This identity allows me to connect with a lot of marginalized people. Being biracial, I have understood what it means to feel outcasted from certain spaces. Similarly, being queer was not always the easy either. While these aspects of my identity made life difficult at times, they ultimately forced me to be confident in my own skin. In this sense, I can see myself being a source of guidance especially for young, Black campers and queer identifying campers who may not feel completely comfortable in their identities. I would love to be a resourse and model for them.

I am also a first - generation college student. Being first – gen, I had a hard time integrating to the new environment of college. I am sure there will be some campers who have a difficult time integrating at first and I can be a voice that understands their circumstances, and helps them feel more connected. 

My main interest at the moment is androgynous fashion blogs. Androgynous fashion has been one of the greatest things to help me feel confident and comfortable in my identity. I do not think that clothing should be gendered, and these blogs show me that I can dress however I want without subscribing to any gender norms and still look and feel good. I can bring this energy and philosophy to camp, and hopefully guide kids to express their individuality in a variety of different ways.
","This is my first attempt at a real poem this year: 

I’d like to be a mountain
Not because they are big and tough
But because I could see more of the world and that would be enough

I’d like to be rapper 
Not just because they can spit a clean verse
But because I want to make the game a little more diverse

I’d like to be a therapy dog 
Not because they look cute and change lives
But because I want to help those around me strive to survive

I’d like to be a backpack 
Not because they keep all of your belongings straight
But because they have your back and help carry the weight

I’d like to be a bird
Not because they are the world’s best flyers
But because their free spirits lift everything higher

I’d like to be so many things in this world
Not because they are the best things that I’ve seen
But because they bring out important parts of my being.

","Squish. The moisture seeped through my left sock wrapping my left foot with a cold embrace. Splosh. The dampness flooded through my right sock and swaddled my right foot with a soggy squeeze. “Welcome to the Rainy Day Cafe!” Standing barefoot under our outdoor cover that protected us from the pouring rain, my older brother and I skipped around our balcony. Grabbing our only menu–a single 8 by 11 sheet of printer paper “laminated” with the clearest scotch tape we could find, we waited patiently as our parents carefully contemplated the two options on our menu–a slice of white bread and toast. Ordering two toasts and our “daily special,” a tall glass of milk, my parents waited patiently as my brother and I took our sweet time looking for the bread and figuring out the buttons on the toaster. I remember feeling so resourceful when my brother had found a jar of peach jam and we excitedly prepared to wow our parents with our peach jam toasts. Wowed and satiated by our culinary innovation, my parents left a $2 tip, a dollar for each of us, and proceeded on with their days. My brother and I, on the other hand, were bouncing off the walls, having earned a dollar of our very own. Thus, the pitter patter of raindrops will always be one of my favorite sounds, reminding me that the Rainy Day Cafe is back in business. 
","Making friendship bracelets is my kryptonite. Double right hand knots and double left hand knots are knot only a solid way to start a friendship bracelet, but also an amazing way to begin a friendship. Finding the right words and feelings to string together and express my love and appreciation for friends and family was always a little difficult but stringing threads together allows me to express my affection and fondness without saying a single word.
I also live for the outdoors, particularly for trail games. Spending hours on the car and trail together, my family would cycle through endless riddles and seemingly infinite rounds of contact and twenty-one. Especially since my dad lives on the other side of the world, trail games tied my family together as we bonded through synchronized shouts of random fruits and car brands. For this, trail games have always and will always hold a dear place in my heart. 
Finally, I like to push myself to step outside of my comfort zone–whether it be fly-fishing, auditioning for a band with an instrument I’ve never played, or simply mixing sprite with fruit punch (it’s actually really good). I’ve learned that by opening myself up to more options, I have discovered more about my own interests and my preferences and therefore have become a more mindful individual. 
","I would love to teach friendship bracelet braiding. After an eight-year hiatus from this magical art form, I was reunited with this thrilling activity when the second graders in the chinese school class I TA’d taught me the classic chevron pattern in an intense 15 minute-break braid-frenzy. The most rewarding part of the friendship bracelet process, however, is the hearing the little gasp that escapes your friend’s mouth when you gift them a little woven piece of your heart. I’d really like to spread this love so that more people can share little woven pieces of their own hearts.
","Community. Bringing people together from all walks of life, Camp Kesem creates an unique loving, supportive, and understanding community of people bonded together by the same passions and concerns. While I cannot, at any capacity, understand the significant emotional impact that kids who have parents struggling with cancer must endure, I want to be part of a community that transports children who have been forced to grow up quickly to a world free of the stress and worry at home. Moreover, from concentration-64 and quack-diddly-oso to their own personal experiences, I want to learn as much from the campers for they are as much the creators of the carefree community I, too, wish to return to. With this mindset in place, I hope to lead campers through a week of whoopee and personal growth!",,https://imgur.com/a/Jwwl0rs, (https://hillelatstanford.wufoo.com/cabinet/enlrZWg3azE3amFrMmk=/pFzmlCxmcU0%3D/),Asia Zhang,12/6/18, (https://hillelatstanford.wufoo.com/cabinet/enlrZWg3azE3amFrMmk=/pFzmlCxmcU0%3D/),Asia Zhang,12/6/18,12/6/18 21:51,public,12/6/18 22:48,public,128.12.254.132,6,1

","My mom really likes the song “I Believe I Can Fly.” I remember when I was little she would play it after picking my sister and I up from school. We would dance around the house singing along to the song with our hands stuck out like wings. I remember I used to jump off my bed and pretend that I was flying. Now whenever I listen to that song it reminds me of my mom and I really love it.

There is really cool wildlife and nature in California and I would love to explore it with the kids at the camp. I also really like crafts and would be excited to do that with kids. 
","I love being outside and doing camping/camp like activities. I also know what it’s like to have to watch someone you really care about suffer through cancer. In my case, it was my grandmother who had breast cancer and it was one of the worst time periods in my life. This seems like a great opportunity to let these kids have some fun and do great things. There's something special about being outside and I want to be able to bring that to these campers. 
","My mom is an immigrant from the Caribbean while my dad is from a suburb of Chicago meaning I grew up in a bicultural, bi-ethnic household and both my sister and I are biracial.

","Setting: An apartment in Northern Georgia, Elementary School
Synopsis: Everyday after school, my sister and I would hurry home to catch the next  installment of the Goldie and Rico Show. At the time, we had no cable, phones or computers; instead, this show aired directly in our shared bedroom, hosted by our older brother. Goldie, a golden retriever stuffed animal, would embark on a new journey with his partner in crime, Rico, a brown puppy plushie. Each episode would be filled with adventure, comedy, and occasionally, tragedy. One particularly tragic episode involved Tommy, a plastic lizard with a predisposition to unlucky situations. While they battled their way across The Frozen Tundra, Tommy was trapped in the villain’s icy prison. By the end of the episode, Tommy was saved, but by then it was too late: our refrigerator’s freezer had already had a fatal effect on our young hero. His frozen body fractured, Goldie and Rico realized their friend was gone. In sync, my sister and I broke into sobs; we had become emotionally attached to Tommy. To this day, my sister and I recall mournfully that episode, and then laugh nostalgically at the numerous other episodes that filled us with joyfulness. The Goldie and Rico Show, though it’s series finale has long past, still remains potent in my memory. Like any good children’s show, it taught us how to dream, how to be brave, and above all, strengthened the bonds between me and my siblings with bravo and jest. 


","1. I worked at Subway for a summer, where my official job titles were Shift Leader, Store Closer, Store Opener, Sandwich Artist, Ingredient Prepper, Cookie Patisserie, and Janitor. Though I did have to learn how to do every job, the most important thing I learned was I loved making people happy— whether that’s through great customer service and making a superb sandwich (and I can make a mean sandwich) or any other means. One thing is for certain though; this innocuous summer job taught me that no matter how difficult or touchy the situation, I wanted to help people through community service for the rest of my life, because there truly is no better feeling than making someone else smile. 

2. I studied abroad in Seoul, South Korea for a summer, where outside of daily language classes we were put in unfamiliar situations we soon learned to navigate in a language foreign to us. One valuable thing I learned during this program was how to chant instinctively in Korean (the words “ready” and “Korea” in Korean are forever ingrained in my memory!).

3. I love dancing - despite being horrible at it. That did not stop me from performing not once, but twice in front of my school at annual International Nights, and definitely won’t stop me as I explore dance groups here at Stanford (this goes hand in hand with my love of musicals and piano, which is another story!). 
","I have always been passionate about learning languages, and even more so in a way that is inclusive and fun! One of my favorite memories while abroad was learning Korean chants and songs at Hanmi camp, a day long exchange with Korean high school students. I would be thrilled to teach camp songs in other languages, particularly American Sign Language, which I began learning this year. With expressions that utilize the whole body, ASL is an amazing language to learn within a group of people. Together, we can create camp songs in both English and ASL that gets everyone hype!

","It’s the moments in life when we laugh the most, cry the most, and are the most vulnerable that stick with us the longest. At Camp Kesem, the opportunity to uplift and support children in an extremely vulnerable time in their life is immeasurable. Having a parent suffer with cancer or losing a parent to the disease can cast a dark shadow over their entire childhood. It’s my hope that by volunteering at Camp Kesem, I can help provide that crucial light they need to mitigate some of the negative effects of cancer. While having a parent with cancer does teach one selflessness and how to put themselves before others, everyone, especially children, deserve to have time where the focus is on them, and they don’t have to feel guilty about it. I want to help show the campers that it’s okay for them to feel whatever they feeling, it’s okay to have fun, and it’s okay to define themselves in any way they want to define themselves. In addition, I’m extremely interested in everything that comes before and after Camp Kesem; not just the camp, but also fundraising and promoting awareness and support for children with a parent with cancer. I hope that as a volunteer counselor, I can help make Camp Kesem a place where these campers laugh the most, feel comfortable being as vulnerable as they want, and most of all, stays in their minds the longest as one of the best weeks of their lives. ","I exist at the intersection of many communities, most of which I’ve know about for the majority of my life. I’ve had time to process and adjust to the identities and communities I belong to — I find solace in my local community, which has a significant African American population as well as immigrant; support from my friends, who either also identify as LGBTQ+ or are unabashed allies; and I learned how to navigate college as a low-income student from multiple programs and student groups. However, one community I never expected to be a part of so soon was the child of a parent with cancer. As I was starting this application, I got a call from my father that changed my perspective on everything. He had a brain tumor; the same kind of cancer that claimed the life of his mother, my grandmother, when he was young. My dad, who had been deported when I was in middle school and out of my life even longer, was dying because he didn’t have access to the healthcare he needed in Jamaica. As a counselor, I want to support campers in particular who like me may be struggling with feelings of guilt because they may not be close to the parent with cancer for any reason, kids who trying to function at the intersection of communities as well as manage the effects of cancer, and those who have to worry about the financial impact of cancer, rather than their own growth.","Camp Kesem is amazing!

Though I haven't worked with this age group in an outdoor context, I am definitely open to preparing and taking on the challenge!","Role: Instructor, Code for Palestine
Dates: July 2018 - August 2018
Description: I taught design to incoming high school freshman in Gaza.  While the camp was centered around education, there were moments everyday where I was able to bring the exciting camp atmosphere.","Role: Assistant Instructor, Galileo Summer Camps
Dates: June 2017 - July 2017
Description: I worked with middle schoolers in Menlo Park as they went through a class that pushed their creativity. I also helped run games and participated in other camp activities with them.","Code for Palestine - As much as it was about volunteering to teach, I feel as though the kids truly appreciated that we were there for them. Given that they don't really have access to foreigners all that often, it was important that we were there to listen to them. They are an extremely devoted group of kids and sometimes they seem just as grown up as myself. But there were always times I would remember that they are still just kids and being there to listen goes a long ways.

Stanford Varsity Synchronized Swimming - This organization has been an incredibly huge part of my time at Stanford. This strong group of women are truly my team both in and out of the pool. They have taught me about following your passions and serve as examples of what dedication looks like. This group has allowed me to grow in so many different ways, and through it I feel like I have contributed by leading by example.

Chi Omega - A phrase that this group holds closely is ""empowered women, empower women"" and the values behind that motto are seen in everyone in this sorority. Since joining this strong group of women, I have learned from those around me as well as matured as a leader, now taking on more executive roles and responsibilities within the chapter.","So this might be a stretch of the word 'favorite'... but this memory has stuck with me for years. When I was younger, I was backpacking with my parents and a friend of mine. This area had a lot of cows -- and I mean a lot. During the day this was great, however once night fell, things took a turn. As my friend and I were playing cards in our tent we realized it was time for a bathroom break. As we walked across our site toe the designated ""bathroom tree"" adorned with a roll of toilet paper, we heard the sound of hooves trotting across the dirt. We looked left and through the thin beam of our flashlight, we see a seemingly aggressive cow who was not a fan of our little 1am excursion. As the cow rushes towards us, we run as fast as we can back to the tent, eventually climbing inside an zipping ourselves to safety. Silent as mice, we listened as the cow brushed up against our tent, of course thinking what any ten year olds would think; this is it, we're going to get eaten by a cow. Not to mention that this wasn't even the first time the two of us had gotten charged by an animal, but that's a story for another time... Eventually the clicking of cow hooves fades away, and we resume our card game. To this day, I can't see a cow without remember this hair raising night.","Firstly, I am really passionate about design and incorporating it into all aspects of my life. Everything from a daily plan to my dorm room incorporates thoughtful design. That being said, I am also a very big fan of spontaneity! The second thing you should know is that I love adventure. Growing up camping and backpacking a lot, the outdoors is somewhere I truly feel happy and free. But for me adventure extends into everyday life. Whether that means trying new foods or finding new places to study, I try to find ways to change up my normal routine.

Lastly, I think it is important to mention that I'm basically just a large child (well kind of, if you count 5'1"" as 'large')! But seriously, I've always had a sense of wonder about the world and am driven by curiosity. I love figuring out the world by experiencing it. I have a general enthusiasm for life and the excitement it brings! While many of my friends would say I have a bubbly personality, I like to think of it as optimistic. Oftentimes, I am the one people can count on to ground them and lift them up if they're down.","I would be very excited to facilitate a storytelling session! This past summer, I had my campers write and perform shadow puppet stories, and was quite literally moved to tears. Kids have so much creativity and ideas and giving them an outlet, whether through words, music, videos, and even puppets provides an opportunity for them to speak and know that they are being heard.","Volunteering at the camp in Gaza last summer opened my eyes to what it really means to work with kids. The kids at the camp are faced with difficult situations everyday, far more than I could have imagined. But hearing their resilience was inspiring and drove me to get to know them on a deeper level. I was able to hear them open up about the problems they faced both personally, and on a larger scale. In many situations, I was able to be confidant, supportive, and even just a number one fan. The experience of being able to guide them through difficult situations was extremely rewarding for me personally, just as I hope it was rewarding for them to be able to open up to someone. I was also able to be the person they could talk to when they wanted to forget about their struggles.

The campers are facing challenging times and they should have a place to go to when they want to forget about those challenges. However, Kesem also provides the opportunity to become more comfortable with facing struggles. I want to be that person that they can confide in and be the one they can come to to talk through anything from their emotions, to their favorite type of pizza. Volunteering at Kesem would provide a similar opportunity to create connections with campers that are meaningful and important. ",,"https://imgur.com/kfWf0dT

The expeditions were backcountry canoeing and backpacking trips three to four days in length, with no immediate access to emergency help. I was responsible for the safety and fun of six to eight campers. The expeditions were incredible opportunities for my campers to explore, discover, and step outside their comfort zone, and I took immense pride in helping them grow. Singing songs while hiking through rainstorms and motivating my campers to canoe against seemingly hurricane-like winds taught me how to keep everyone positive even when clouds were gray. My knowledge of silly card games, wilderness survival tips, and canoe paddle strokes are nearly infinite—but that's not what makes me best suited for OLP. It's my experience in lifting kid's frowns into smiles even when friendships seem shaky and activities unfair. That's what'll make Camp Kesem the best year yet for campers in OLP.","Role: Special Olympics Coach

I was elected president of the magazine, leading weekly discussions and making a point of publishing students who want their voices heard.

Experience: Photography
Description: I love photographing movement, from the trajectory of birds and skateboarders to time lapses of water currents and traffic patterns. Photography has made me a keen observer of the natural world that surrounds us.","My favorite childhood memories revolve around the trees of my neighborhood, my Aunt's garden, and my Grandpa's senior home. Growing up in New York City, these trees were places where my imagination could run wild, providing an escape from the rigid grid and unforgiving crowds that dominated the city. I lived in an apartment complex on the lower east side that constantly changed landlords. Behind my building was a tree that almost became my second home, given how much time my brother and I spent up in its branches. This tree was responsible for more than one scabbed knee and leaf piles, but as it grew, so did I. My Aunt has a fig tree, growing precariously out of her tiny front yard garden. My Mom, my brother, and I would visit her every summer of my childhood, so its sweet fruit would come to symbolize family. Finally, the tree that grows behind my Grandpa's senior home in the Bronx was harsh and rough, with leaves that cut and scrape. But I remember climbing to the top as immensely rewarding, presenting a panoramic view of the Bronx in all its evening splendor.","I love to explore, whether it be a stream or a city. Having the freedom to explore as a kid was when I discovered, laughed, and grew. I want to make sure campers at Kesem can have the same experience.

I really, really enjoy making things with my hands. Whether it be whittling a spoon or building a raft out of cardboard, I plan on making things for the rest of my life.

Finally, I love food with all my heart. I made each expedition at my camp a gourmet trip, cooking up a disaster for every meal.
 ","I would be excited to teach wilderness skills and how to live in nature without leaving a mark. In the Adirondacks, a national park in upstate New York, this concept was called ""Woodcraft"". I want to make sure every camper can feel safe and free to explore nature. Discovering animal prints and building shelters are incredibly fun.","Camp Kesem offers me the opportunity to spread my love for nature with my favorite demographic, kids.

 ",One of my all time favorite childhood memories was finally learning how to do the “big girl” monkey bars at the park right by my house. I remember the sense of accomplishment and the congratulatory hug that my grandpa gave me. ,"I have always been the ""mom friend"" in any of my friend groups.
I love love love anything that has to do with music.
I bake when I get stressed, and I get stressed a lot.","I would love to be able to facilitate some sort of activity that involves singing or some other type of musical ability. As a child, one of my most memorable parts of camps were the silly nonsense songs that we would learn. I still remember my mom's annoyance by me singing each song (complete with hand motions) for weeks after camp would end. I still know most of the songs to this day, and I would love to give kids these types of memories.","As a child my grandfather was my hero. We spent almost every day together, he taught me to tie my shoes, to face my fears and he would even often let me paint his nails. Unfortunately, he had lung cancer when I was young and later died from a brain tumor when I was eight. While I don't know exactly how it feels to loose a parent to cancer, I have come pretty close and I would love to be able to support kids during this difficult time in their lives.  ","As a first-generation, low income student here at Stanford, I know that it can be very difficult to come from a different background than the rest of your peers and how overwhelming it can feel at times. I come from a town that has less people than the Stanford Class of 2022, so the transition to such a busy, populated area has been difficult. This being said, I have learned a lot about resilience in my short time here and I think that this applies a lot in the situations I'm sure many of these children from diverse socioeconomic groups feel.","*to the tune of the chorus of Rex Orange County's 'Best Friend'""

","Do you remember what the first day of school felt like? What it still feels like? There’s something about it, a particular enthusiasm that’s almost indescribable. In 5th grade, I moved elementary schools and this first day was both exhilarating... and absolutely terrifying. I didn’t know anyone, but everyone knew each other. I walk into my new classroom wearing a blue shirt with the Hollister logo emblazoned on it, and timidly take a seat. Everyone was arranged in tables that were grouped by color: green, yellow, blue, red, purple. I was assigned to the purple table, but what the heck did that even mean? (Spoiler alert: At the purple table, I meet the person who later becomes my best friend of 10+ years) I’m immediately greeted by a teacher with long red hair and bangs, people asking me what my name is, and let me tell you--I am overwhelmed.  Later however, we’re at recess and I’m hanging off the monkey bars with the purple table and we’re laughing so hard we can’t breathe. I don’t remember what was discussed, but I remember having the distinct thought, “Wow. I have never laughed like this before.” I felt an immediate connection with these people; I felt accepted for the first time in my life. It might have just been the eagerness I felt being at a new school, and even though I only knew these people for a few hours, they included me like I was already one of them--like I belonged.","Laughter - Something I do often. I’m a laugher. And when I laugh, it is loud. It’s pretty common that people will tell me things like “I know your approaching because of your laugh,” and “I was sitting on meyer green and I could literally hear you laughing all the way from coupa.” Not only do I enjoy laughing, but I enjoy making others laugh. I value good humor and being able to see the light in things; I use humor to express myself and who I am.

Music - A bit unrelated, but music is what gets me through almost anything. You know those songs that just take you back to a certain time period in your life? Music has a way of making me feel every emotion. It has a way of calming me and being there for me in a way that people sometimes can’t. 

Community - I love feeling connected to a community because we all have something in common, and that common thing is what keeps us united. One of my main communities on campus is one in which every single person, regardless of whether I’m close with them or not, makes me feel accepted for who I am. They are people who make me feel comfortable being my full and complete authentic self; they make me feel empowered to feel confident in my own skin. These are people who will support me when I am at my worst and embolden me at my best.
","Maybe this is a stretch, but I think it would be really cool to facilitate guided meditations (or some type of ""grounding"" exercise). I have some experience facilitating guided meditations/grounding workshops, and while I think it could be challenging to do it with younger kids, I still think that finding ways to de-stress and calm down in times of distress is a really useful skill to have. Something as simple as learning to take a few deep breaths when things are difficult can be helpful, and finding fun ways to facilitate that is a challenge I want to take on.
","I feel like everyone says that they love kids, and I’m still gonna say that I love kids (because I really do), but I think the reason why I want to be part of Camp Kesem is more than that. What really propelled me to apply was talking to a close friend about Kesem. It was right after camp last year, and they detailed a time when people were sharing their experiences, and she initially didn’t think she was going to speak. But as she watched multiple children be vulnerable and open up to one another it encouraged her to do the same. As she was sharing, she said something along the lines of, “I started crying, so much I couldn’t talk anymore, and I suddenly felt all these little hands on my back, hugging me.” As adults, I think we always feel as though we need to support children, but we never think about how they can be sources of support for us. I want to put myself into situations that make me uncomfortable. I want to put myself into situations that challenge me. I want to feel inspired by the grit of children. I want to be vulnerable and share my own experiences with others, but also motivate others to share theirs with me. I want to feel comfort and fear and joy and sadness--feel these emotions completely and feel comfortable being myself in my truest form. I think Kesem will allow me to do just that. 
","Coming from a South Asian background, mental health and emotions overall aren’t things that are talked about often. Throughout all of high school, I struggled with my mental health--to the point that it was debilitating, but never felt like I could tell my family about it. It wasn’t until I came to college that I became more open about my own struggles and finally felt like it was something I could talk about with my family. Since then, I have been working to talk more openly with my family and friends, and they have been working to understand what I’m going through. I think that mental health and expressing emotions are heavily stigmatized with people of color, but I feel that sharing my experiences allow me to set an example by being vulnerable. Being South Asian is a huge part of my identity, and my mental health is something I struggle with every day. I think that these parts of my identity can allow me to connect with campers in a way that shows them it is okay to not be okay, and that what they feel is valid.

I especially enjoyed when I was able to volunteer at the elementary schools. I loved running the carnival game while the kids played. I loved seeing the excitement on their faces when they won, and made sure they weren’t discouraged when they didn’t win. At a different carnival, I painted their faces. It was fun tying in my love for kids and art. I was able to give them choices of what they wanted me to paint and the kids and I loved it, even though I had absolutely no prior experience.

I ran a little event where we allowed the kids to pretend that they were panning for gold and we would mix little fake gold rocks in sand. The kids had so much fun.
",,"The most important group I have been a part of is probably National Honor Society. Through the organization, I learned how important it is to give back to the community. I often worked with my friends and did community service together. I enjoyed earning my hours, whether it was with children, dogs (at the humane society, which is also a passion of mine), or simply with people who are less fortunate. 
","My favorite childhood memory is not really a single memory, but a collection of memories over my childhood. When I look back, I fondly remember spending time with my family. My brother, sister, and many of my cousins are fairly around the same age and we would do countless things together. We have always lived close to each other and went on countless adventures together. It was before everyone had iPhones, but we were never bored. We would come up with our own dances, play made-up games in the swimming pools, or explore the woods that were nearby. We did so many random things back then, but I am grateful to have been able to spend time with the people closest to me. 
","I think the first thing you should know about me is that I am always ready for an adventure. I am super excited to try new things. Whether it’s here at Stanford or trying something new, like working at a camp! The second thing is that I always aim to make other people happy. Here at Stanford, I am one of the birthday fairies in my dorm. On their birthday, I try to make the birthday person as happy as possible. I make them their own personal sign and I want to make the day all about them. I am caring and I want people to be as happy as I can make them. I love seeing the smile on their face when they see I pay attention to what they like. Third, I am a hard worker. In my life, I have not had things handed to me. I have worked hard to have what I have and to be where I am. I worked 25 hours at KFC/Taco Bell during the school week and full time in the summer. KFC/Taco Bell was not a glamorous job. I earned my own money and paid multiple bills all while maintaining good grades and a social life. I am willing to put time and effort into things I am passionate about. ","I don’t have a lot of experience In a camp setting, but I would be super excited to teach kids crafts and other artistic things. I love spending time outside and hiking or swimming. I’m not exactly sure how I would tie that into a teaching aspect, but I could do it if I needed to. I am open to teach pretty much anything honestly. 
","I want to volunteer for Camp Kesem, because I believe the camp is for a really good cause. I can’t imagine what it’s like for a kid to have a parent with cancer. I imagine the parents are stressed enough as it is and the stress may trickle down to the children. I think camp would be a much needed break for both the parents and the children. The kids deserve an escape from the harsh realities around them and I would love to be a part of that experience. I want them to have as much fun as possible and make it possible for them to live in the moment. I consider myself quite empathetic, and if I was in a similar situation I think I would want to be involved in a camp like this. Camp Kesem is a camp for a great cause and I would be honored to devote my time to it. 
","I believe I would add a different perspective as a camp counselor. Compared to people here at Stanford, I think I stand in the minority in many categories. I am first generation, low income. My parents are divorced and I have an estranged relationship with my father. My mom has worked very hard to keep my siblings and I as happy as possible and to make sure we never went without. I have worked steadily since I turned sixteen. I have earned my own money and worked hard to get what I have. I am both Native American and Mexican, so I come from a background of many different cultures. Also just to add a bit more diversity, I am gay too. I am a huge fan of Taylor Swift and she is my queen. Stanford is a very different experience for me, but I am embracing the differences and challenges with an open mind and a smile. 
","One of my favorite things to do, as I mentioned before, as a birthday fairy is to make personal signs for people on their birthdays. I make every birthday sign for the third floor to put on the birthday person's door. I make it as personal as possible, because the people in my dorm are my best friends here at Stanford. It brightens their day and it makes me happy to make them happy. I love doing little drawings on their signs and referencing inside jokes. I don't consider myself too artistic, but my friends love the drawings I make. I don't think I would ever take my art seriously, but I just do it for fun. I don't have a website or anywhere to upload it, so I won't be able to show y'all. Maybe I can if I get an interview or something ;).", (https://hillelatstanford.wufoo.com/cabinet/enlrZWg3azE3amFrMmk=/HKxpC7iUx20%3D/),Javier Lopez,12/6/18, (https://hillelatstanford.wufoo.com/cabinet/enlrZWg3azE3amFrMmk=/HKxpC7iUx20%3D/),Javier Lopez,12/6/18,12/6/18 22:47,public,12/6/18 23:58,public,128.12.255.4,6,1

The trip was amazing. We cooked calzones, went on daily hikes, and swam in the ocean. Yet when looking back on SPOT, what really sticks out to me are the spotlights we shared with one another one the trip. Through only a weeklong trip, I managed to build deep and extremely meaningful connections with peers that had been virtual strangers to me days before. I would love to work with OLP to help recreate this experience for others. There is a level of privilege that comes with working with older kids– you ""babysit"" less, but an layer of responsibility is added as well– older campers are capable of deeper, more introspective thinking, and we owe it to them as counselors to facilitate these discussions and be the listener they need. I know how powerful the bonds created on trips like this can be, and I want to play a part in creating them. ","Tutor, Service Crew Tutoring Program- As part of my service crew, worked with a group of other teens to create a program we participated in every Thursday evening in East Oakland to tutor the children of Burmese refugees. Some children had limited English skills, but that didn’t stop us from having a halloween costume party, imparting serious “middle school advice” (don’t play zap!), and attempting to read the Harry Potter books together. (2014-2018)

Lifeguard & Swim Instructor, Piedmont Community Pool- Taught swim lessons for a few summers at my community pool. I am lifeguard certified, and the lessons I taught ranged from group lessons, to private lessons, to toddler sessions. (Summer 2016- Summer 2018)","YMCA Camp Gorham: Camper (2012-2015), TAG 2016-  As a “TAG,” (aka CIT),  I spent a month working with the rest of my group to plan activities for young campers (we created an amazing camp-wide version of monopoly), shadow counselors (learned it takes forever to put 7 year old girls to bed), and participate in leadership building activities (we built a raft out of driftwood and inner-tubes and attempting to float across the lake). 

Senior Patrol Leader, Piedmont Cub Scout Camp- I worked with adult Scouting leaders to plan program, find campers, and recruit staff to lead our community’s one week cub scout camp. I managed forty 5-10 year old boys and oversaw 15 teenage staff members. Highlights include crafting a complex “pirate” scavenger hunt, mediating the aftermath of tense archery competitions, and remedying countless bee stings. (Summer 2016 & 2017)","Rebuilding Together Oakland Project, Youth House Captain (2016, 2017, mentor 2018)- led an annual project in which my community service crew partnered with a local non-profit to rebuild a low-income, elderly, or disabled Oakland resident’s home. My service worked to build community between my white wealthy “super zip” of Piedmont, CA, with the impoverished communities of Oakland we were serving. 
 
 
Share Y(our) Voice, Co-Founder (2017,2018)- In reaction to the 2016 election and a subsequent anti-semitic incident that shook my high school’s campus, I created and lead a coalition of clubs that holds school-wide restorative speaking events. While the performances were powerful, my club’s most lasting impact manifested itself in the diverse, open community of previously marginalized students it brought together. 

Actress, Piedmont High school’s Advanced Acting Class (2014-2018): From clowning freshman year, to competing in a bird calling contest Sophomore year, to performing the story of a rape survivor in my schools “consent assembly” my junior year, my acting class pushed me to my limits while giving me the support needed to stretch. 
","I was born in Buffalo, NY; a rust-belt, snowy city in upstate New York located on the shores of Lake Erie. It’s waterfront is lined with the skeletons of antiquated grain elevators and factories, its city streets weave through plots of vacant lots and abandoned houses. While Buffalo is known for its terrible weather, most of my memories there take place outside, on my block, where I roamed with my “neighborhood gang:” a ragtag group of siblings, classmates, and nextdoor neighbors. I was the leader– the fearless leader– of the bunch; coordinating raids on the “scary teenagers’” backyard parties to steal beers out of sheer curiosity, marshalling our day-long, brutal lemonade stand endeavors in which, after dividing up the money, we each earned no more than five dollars, and organizing our soccer matches, wii tournaments, and scavenger hunts. 
	In my prime, around 7th grade, I’d spend countless hours every weekend making my scavenger hunts. Spanning our entire neighborhood, I’d scatter clues from our houses, to jungle gyms, to store fronts, to our neighbors’ dog collars. After meticulously hiding the cards, I’d round up the troops and, as they squealed and jumped excitedly, lay upon them their challenge for the day: “find the hidden treasure,” “break into the bank,” or “crack the code.” While I wasn’t able to compete in searching for treasure or bank notes, I didn’t need to– through my sticky notes, crafted codes, and careful team creation, I’d already discovered what makes me happy.
","I have an award-winning bird call in my back pocket. My Sophomore year of high school, I participated in and won the Piedmont Bird Calling Contest, an annual community-cherished event in which I performed the call of the Common Raven. It was probably one of the coolest and most embarrassing things I’ve ever done, as my partner and I performed a skit based off of the TV show “That’s so Raven” that preceded to our killer call.
I’m biracial. This makes up a huge part of my identity. My dad is Indian, and my mom is white. I’ve struggled all my life with fully understanding my identity. When I lived in Buffalo, I attended an incredibly diverse magnet school where most of my peers regarded me as white. Yet upon moving to Piedmont, CA, an overwhelmingly white small town, I immediately became known as the “new ethnic friend.” I’ve dealt with the question “what are you?” countless times, and it’s motivated me to get more involved outwardly in my community’s racial issues, as well as turn inward to discover for myself my own identity. My junior year, I was baptized into my religion of Zoroastrianism with a Navjote (similar to a bar mitzvah) and now practice. 
I run a foodie account. It’s called @bitesbypa (follow!!!) and covers all of the best restaurants and haunts in Palo Alto. It’s small, but I’m having a lot of fun exploring Palo Alto, eating a lot, and learning new photography and editing skills.
","Swimming! Anything having to do with water. I’ve taught swim lessons for the past few summers, and am CPR lifeguard certified. I love working with kids in the water. I played water polo in high school, so I’ve had my fair share of wild, late night games of sharks and minnows, “steal the bacon,” and impromptu synchronized swimming competitions. I would also love to teach some drama classes. After four years of acting, I have a ton of fun improv games up my sleeve, and I know I'll bring the energy needed to lead not only fun but meaningful exercises.","“Brrrr! It’s colder than a polar bear’s toenails!” I’d scream every morning at 6:00am before plunging into the frigid cold waters of YMCA Camp Gorham’s mountain lake. For countless summers growing up, Gorham was my home. Located in the mountains of upstate New York, Gorham transformed me from a shy bookish nerd into a brazen, gregarious, well… ham. At Gorham, I made my first international friend, had my first kiss, my first real leadership experience (through TAG). Yet while I miss the raucous campfire songs (“Little Red Wagon” was a personal favorite), what I miss most are the deep, lasting connections I’d build with my campmates every year. Almost the entire time I was in elementary school, my grandmother was in and out of the hospital due to kidney disease. It was an incredibly hard time for my mom and my family, and I can only imagine how powerful it must be for the campers to have a safe place where they can talk about what they’re going through. I want to help campers build the strong connections I was lucky to have at camp, and help them take comfort in their shared experiences. In the same way that a certain uninhibited and infinite feeling comes only in moments like jumping into freezing lakes on early mornings, I believe that deep, meaningful connections are best formed when away from home, technology, and our comfort zones, and I want to help create those at Kesem. 
","My Junior year of high school, I acted in my high school’s consent assembly, in which I told the true story of an alum who was raped during her time at my school. Attempting to put myself in her shoes was one of the most challenging things I’ve ever done. After a close friend disclosed to me that she was a victim of sexual assault, I was inspired to bring New York Times bestselling author Peggy Orenstein to speak to my student body about hookup culture. Peggy’s incredible. We hit it off, and I’ve been interning for her ever since. Since her debut book “Girls & Sex,” Peggy has been writing a new book on boys, and I’ve been helping her research by conducting interviews with girls and boys here at Stanford. I now view the world through the lense of gender inequality and toxic hookup culture, and I plan to bring this work experience to Kesem. I want to work with young female campers to help empower them from an earlier age– I want to talk to them and lead exercises about body image, social media, sexuality, and confidence. These issues are everywhere– but are always shoved “under the carpet,” and I believe that I have the skills and experience necessary to start these conversations.

I was where they were not too long ago. When I was in high school, it meant so much to me to have upperclassmen seriously invest time and energy into knowing me. I had a lot of questions and concerns, and I’m sure they do too. High school can be really tough, and I would love to help these up and coming adults feel a little more prepared. Sometimes that’s just being the goofy counselor who’s down for good hangs. Sometimes it’s being willing to be real and vulnerable myself so that they know they’re not alone. In either case, I think it’s important, especially at this age, to have someone who will speak love into your life, if only for a week. They’re ready for that. If they’re like me, they’re craving it. Craving people who acknowledge them as the young adults they’re becoming. Who aren’t going to sugarcoat things or talk down to them. I think I could be a great mentor and friend to them. Plus, who doesn’t love some nature! The outdoors has also always been an outlet for me growing up. It was my space for thinking and friendventures, and I would love to share that with this group. I don’t have any work experience, but I have done quite a few hikes in Colorado including a 14ner. But mostly just an enthusiasm for trees and fresh air!!","Role: Camp Small Group Leader @ Crossroads Church Camp

","Growing up, my family lived in SoCal and my cousins lived in Illinois. Just about every other year, they would come down to California for Christmas though, and we’d go to Disneyland. We would wake up really early and all 10 of us would squeeze into the vans. I always had on my Mickey’s ears on. We would car-karaoke on the way up...for all of about 10 minutes before us kids fell asleep, but we always woke up in time to see the ‘welcome’ sign. It’s like we just knew. We’d spend the whole day riding rides, snacking on pretzels and churros, until our parents would leave to set up blankets and save the family seats for Fantasmic -- their big nightly water parade -- while the kids continued riding. And as seasoned veterans, we always had the perfect seats. When it was time for the show, we would help grab clam chowder bread bowls and hot chocolate. Our Disney dinner tradition. I was an insanely messy kid growing up, and so, without fail, every year I would spill my hot chocolate on our Disney blankets. I eventually had a stained blanket reserved just for me. And right after the show, we would watch fireworks and fake soap-snow would fall from the sky. I know it’s not a single memory, so slightly cheating, but the years where we went to Disney were always really ‘magical’. Definitely some of the happiest years of my life at the happiest place on earth.","1. I’m a Christian
2. I make BOMB snickerdoodles
3. I can seamlessly rap the entire Hamilton soundtrack (I make no claim to sounding good though)
","I would LOVE to teach Zumba! In my experience, it’s perfect for refocusing the mind and brightening spirits. The moves would easy to learn while still taking advantage of all that high-level camp energy. I’d have a few routines that are repeated throughout the week so campers can become familiar with them. This will get them excited for their favorite ones and give them a chance to really get the hang of the choreography and hopefully enhance their confidence! It would definitely help grow community as they dance and sing along to sick jams.","I really, really want to spend a week truly loving these kids. I want to make them feel heard. I want to give them a space to remember their parents, be vulnerable, and just let go of all the weight they’ve been carrying. A safe place to truly let go of the pressure and responsibility. Where they can lose the labels and expectations for a week. It’s important to me that they feel known, by name, for who they are, not what they’ve endured. They deserve that. Life can be tough, really tough, but to be a kid while juggling this...I can’t even begin to imagine what they might be feeling. But I want to be there for them. I am more than happy to give them my shoulder to lean on, a big ol’ hug when they need it, a corny joke, or one of the awesome cookies I was talking about. Providing them with whatever support they needed would be my number one goal if I was a counselor. And that they have FUN! They deserve a chill week to have gooey marshmallows, go lake jumping, connect with other kids who actually understand what they're going through, and just be. 
	I think Camp Kesem’s mission breathes hope into the world. It gives back to kids who have lost so much already. For a week, they can laugh and make memories, and use lots of glitter. Camp makes lives better, and I am ALL about that.","I’m Dutch, Indonesian, and African American. My whole life I’ve struggled with feeling like an “other”. I never felt like I quite belonged to either of my cultural groups. I wasn't white enough, visibly, but I wasn’t black enough either. Or at least that’s what I was told with regards to my personality. My parents were also divorced, so I lived in two very culturally different houses, leaving me constantly conflicted. There simply wasn’t a place for me. 
Recently, my friend taught me a Hawaiian word: muliwai. Muliwai is the mouth of a river where the fresh and salt water mix. Since there is so much diversity in Hawaii and many people are multicultural, people have begun identifying with this word. The beautiful point at which the two waters meet is incredibly distinct, so only very specific flora and fauna can thrive there; they literally cannot survive anywhere else. This really resonated with me. My personal experience of wrestling with belonging and identity has shaped my heart so new perspectives and empathies to thrive. My experiences are by no means more important than others, but it is entirely mine. Unique. I know what it’s like to not fit in. To feel lost in my own skin. But I also know what it’s like to find a home and identity in more than just labels. And I want to help campers discover what that looks like for themselves as they traverse the difficult, confusing times of growing into their own skin.","https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uuzdbcus1nOZveWzGmUWRS2o7y6VHEmH/view?usp=sharing

I think that as a 15- and 16-year-old, there is a beauty and freedom that the outdoors can give you to. The ability to take ownership of your presence in the outdoors is a responsibility that is empowering in and of itself. When you add in LNT (leave no trace) principles, along with the basic skills to enjoy your trip outdoors, there are a multitude of layers to growth that can occur. I also believe that, as someone who grew up in a family where camping outdoors was not common, that exposure to camping/hiking are great ways to rekindle self-love and affirmation, alongside time to reflect and think.

","My dad always had a knack for turning the ordinary into an experience. He turned casual Saturday breakfast into a pancake tasting fest with every fruit we had in the kitchen making an appearance. He knew just how to make folding clothes a sing-a-long session (much to the chagrin of my mom). This story is not far off.

  “Okay son, you ready to go on an adventure?” With my bike ready, my dad outfitted his sturdy mountain bike with lights and filled up our water bottles for the trek ahead. I was stoked to share my dad’s passion for cycling with him, and he knew just how to catch my attention in his sport of choice.  

My favorite adventure that he ever took me on was when I was about 11, at about 8:30pm when he said that we were going to be following the trails of the Redhawk Golf Course! The Golf Course was an unusual choice, deviating from the normal route we took around town – and in hindsight, I should have known he had something up his sleeve. We got geared up and rode through the darkness following the ups and downs and twists and turns of the course – it was magical. The way that the sprinklers hit my face, followed by the leaving my face dry and chilly revealed a behemoth smile on my face. I’ll never forget this night I spent with my dad and it taught me to always cherish the little things.","(1) I love photography. I think it represents the rawest form of art and allows me to capture a moment in life in its fullest. When I have a photo session, my favorite photos are always the ones during transition, the “candid” photos if you will, where the people I’m with are wearing their fullest, most whole smile.
(2) My spirit animal is a marmot. The first (and maybe most important) reason is that I found this video (bit.ly/kesemmarmot [ample warning: volume should be at medium]) and resonated with it on an otherworldly level. The marmot scream (yell? call?) is the level of energy and passion that I hope to exude on a day-to-day basis.
(3) I have a tattoo that represents my family that reads “∆21L”. The multiple meanings in this tattoo include: a reminder of change, a sign that I share a name with my dad, a sign that I share a birthday with my mom, and that I have a little brother!
","When I was younger (and to this day), I often found myself getting into weird niche hobbies. One of these hobbies was making duct tape wallets. I found myself entranced by the way that something so ordinary could be made into bright and colorful creations.  In that vein, I would love to teach kids how to use duct tape to create wallets with fun designs that show their interests, hobbies, favorite colors, or favorite shapes!
","Cancer affects everyone to some degree – for some it’s first hand, for other’s its second or even third. But regardless to whatever degree *you’re* affected by cancer, support is a necessity. Growing up, my best friend’s mom, Laura, was diagnosed with Leukemia. Now that I’m years removed, realizing the heartbreaking effects on my friend’s family, on my mom (who was her best friend), and on Laura is devastating. Luckily enough, Laura entered remission – and through this process, I saw my mom becoming a large source of support for my best friend and her family. Seeing the importance of being a source of support, in conjunction with my work with SUDM, I firmly believe that being an ally and support system to those affected by cancer is of the utmost importance and when possible, should be an opportunity one takes wholeheartedly. For these reasons, I would love to volunteer my time to Camp Kesem!","When I get together with my family for Thanksgiving dinner, I like to think that we’re an interpretation of a modern family. 

On the kitchen island there’s an array of American Thanksgiving food interspersed between the Filipino delicacies – there are green beans, lumpia, turkey, amongst others. But more importantly are the people surrounding the table – my Caucasian mom, Filipino dad, Filipina immigrant lola, hippie grandma, gay uncles, Mormon aunt and uncle. 
 
The political and social divide couldn’t be greater, but amongst it I have learned to love, I have learned to accept, and I have learned to learn. I think that my ability to look past difference and find common ground could be a valuable asset to the camp community and can allow me to bring new perspectives to the table. During my time at Stanford, finding ways to create inclusive and diverse experiences while preserving the sanctity of individual experience has been one of my goals. I think that with my familial background, work as a Coordinator for Diversity and Inclusion, and my experience as a frosh staffer, I would hope to bring aspects of each facet of my life to Kesem and share my whole self with these kids. I think that the adults in my life growing up used their power of giving kids a role model who believes wholly in them is the reason that I am where I am today, and I hope to do the same for the kids of Kesem.",https://imgur.com/a/hv8qInu, (https://hillelatstanford.wufoo.com/cabinet/enlrZWg3azE3amFrMmk=/m4Gx3r3BkVI%3D/),Arnold (A.J.)

",N/A,"Graphic Novel Project: 
A class in which our team of six wrote, edited, and drew a 90 page graphic novel. I served as the unofficial project lead and was challenged to get 6 very different personalities and artists to collaboratively create.  I also served as unofficial moral booster, bringing energy, puns, and laughter to long work days. An important lesson in humility, hard-work, and team building. 

PHE:
Currently the PHE in Serra and have come to appreciate the subtle ways in which community is built. Hosting Teas with the PHE that bleed into 2am heart-to-hearts have been the highlight so far. I share openly about my personal struggles and setbacks regarding academics and identity that both my residents and co-staff have appreciated. 


I’ve devoted a significant chunk of time these last 3 years to enjoying the sunshine and grass. Going barefoot to class, stopping to try the sketch campus fruit. I’m a true believer in taking deep breaths and that the little moments of rest and reflecting make all the difference. Five minutes of class can be perfectly substituted with five minutes of squishing earth with bare toes. 
","Our neighbors in Portland had two kids around the same age as my brother sister and I, all of us self-described nerds, and decided one day to host a science convention. We spent weeks prepping projects and presentations, choreographing dances and composing musical numbers for the opening ceremony, and in the end turned our garage into the first (and last) Convention for Intellectuals. My compelling research on water waste was only topped by the entire backdrop to the closing number catching fire due to a malfunctioning smoke machine.","I’m obsessed with trash and sewer systems and mold patterns.
I am fully honest about my experiences and identities and love to tell stories about them, speak with others questioning identities, and encourage the embracement of all of our individual “weird”.  
My best friend in middle school was a Japanese maple tree. 

","I would love to facilitate craft activities. I’m a tinkerer at heart and grew up sewing, knitting, and making art out of any available resources; soda can earrings, acorn people, moss gnome houses! These past two years my room has been my mini studio.  Art isn’t only about making messes but learning to be resourceful, relax the rules, and adapt to or adopt the unexpected. ","I’ve heard from friends about the incredible impact Camp Kesem has on both it’s counselors and kids. More importantly, I think it’s such a unique space that strives to provide not only escape and a fun summer experience, but also challenges all to have deeper conversations about experiences that aren’t easy to talk about. I think it’s so important for young people to be able to feel safe expressing those emotions and look forward to the opportunity be a part of a community whose culture supports that and be an active listener when they choose to share. Would love the chance to channel all my energy into kids who have just as much and teach a couple cartwheels along the way!

","I spent my entire life moving around the US. I’ve experienced small town rural Indiana, hippy-city Portland, minority majority underserved NYC suburbs, and middle sized college town Illinois. My dad was born in Puerto Rico and my mother in Germany, being mixed-race and having those two cultures are central to who I am and have allowed me to be a chameleon of sorts in all the communities I’ve been a part of.

","Every summer, the BeverLee cafe would open. Because every summer, my cousins would come to visit. The four co-CEOs of BeverLee: my two cousins, Emma and Tamsin (the Beveridges), and my brother Sauyon and I (the Lees) would sleepover at my grandparents house. Staying up past the bedtimes all of our parents collectively set, we would sprawl around the cozy living room eating junk food and watching Avatar. We would drift in and out of sleep until the house began to wake up and we would snap into formation.
The business model was simple: we would pirate the kitchen, raid the pantry, cook disastrous meals and then sell our creations back to our parents and grandparents. 
Tamsin would waitress, collecting orders like “1.5 Didilis (scrambled pancakes)” and “2 banana parfaits (bananas with yogurt drizzled on top)”. Then my brother, head chef, would scramble the Didilis as Emma would help with prep. As dessert chef, I would create all the non-stove meals. Carefully placing the chopped bananas in a ring and pouring over strawberry yogurt, I took pride in the aesthetic quality of my dishes.
Before we could admire our creations, Tamsin would whip back in, take our plates, and serve them. The cafe would close after everyone had paid up (of course, with a lot of tips) and the mess of the kitchen would be left to the poor customers as the four of us would take our new money and hit the town (read: buy snacks from Walgreens).","1. To this day, every summer, my cousins and I cook for breakfast for our parents and grandparents. Though, sadly, we are no longer small and cute enough to charge them AND we have to do kitchen clean up. Growing up is the worst!
2. After living in the exact same room of the exact same house in California for 15 years, I moved to South Korea. This, obviously, taught me a lot of things (like how to speak Korean, for one), but one of the biggest things I took away from it is the importance of communities, specifically camp communities. Though I hate to say it, a lot of my freshman year friendships have faded, but to this day, some of my best friends are from my summer camps and without their constant support I’m not sure if I could have made it through the isolating move.
3. I’m a really big math girl. I’m not sure why that is particularly important, but I find it a big part of my identity and explains a lot of my personality traits. Whatever that means, I’ll leave up to you.
","I love music. I am genuinely very bad at it, but I love music regardless. I have spent many summers at music camps and know how special making music together is: the instant connection, the release of pent-up emotions, the simple, wholesome feel-good vibes. I play a bit of cello and piano and would love to bring some of that to Kesem.
","When I was growing up, my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer. 
Thankfully, she is in remission now. 
This, for the longest time, was one of my most closely guarded secrets. That probably stems from the fact that it was my parents’ most closely guarded secret from me. Only a third grader, it took some real Nancy Drew sleuthing to figure out exactly why my parents were so stressed, and then why my parents left for a “weekend getaway”, and then why when they came back, my mom would wear wigs or big, beautiful head scarves. A book I found hidden in a kitchen cabinet spelled it out for me: Breast Cancer: A Complete Guide. 
To this day, I have never talked to my parents about it. And while growing up, my brother and I pretended it never existed. I don’t regret or resent the way that my family coped with this terrible disease, but I think that having a community and a safe space would have helped ease the anxiety and helplessness that nine-year-old Juyon felt. 
Camp Kesem is that community. Camp Kesem is that safe space. ","For a long time I struggled with my Asian-American heritage and how I fit in with everyone around me. This was only exacerbated when I moved to Korea as I felt like a ""fake"" Korean and that I didn't quite belong despite being ethnically full Korean. I'd hope to instill more pride in others and myself about our Asian heritage and learn together on how to celebrate our shared culture.",https://imgur.com/NTCMEkA, (https://hillelatstanford.wufoo.com/cabinet/enlrZWg3azE3amFrMmk=/GyEIM8zf93k%3D/),Juyon Lee,12/6/18, (https://hillelatstanford.wufoo.com/cabinet/enlrZWg3azE3amFrMmk=/GyEIM8zf93k%3D/),Juyon Lee,12/6/18,12/6/18 23:02,public,12/6/18 23:37,public,68.65.174.192,6,1

Dates: July 2018- August 2018
Description: I spent the majority of my summer working on a campaign for Child Safety Month. This included working with mothers and their children from a local township to create a community art display to honor the children who had lost their lost lives to street related violence. Working with the children who had lost classmates, friends, and siblings was a difficult and incredible experience. These children were incredibly resilient and my impact came from my ability to bring positive energy, patience, and project coordination experience to aid in the installation process as well as long days filming.  When the children felt uncomfortable or tired, I was often the one telling silly jokes, breaking out bad dance moves, or helping them articulate to the older members of the team that it was time for a break.

Role: RA @ Arroyo
Dates: September 2018- Present
Description: Over the past ten weeks I have grown to love this community more than I ever thought would be possible! It exemplifies what occurs when you put time, effort, and care into relationships and the power of active listening and unconditional support! I have learned so much about myself and others as someone who is charged with shaping a community while carefully considering my own role as a facilitator in the community. My biggest impact comes from playing a strong supportive and motivating role. I am someone who tries very hard to make sure others feel comfortable, supported, and empowered to share their thoughts without fear of being judged! 
","As a child, I spent every afternoon in downtown Seattle with my mom. My father would drop me off after a day of running errands to my tired mother who always had the energy for one more adventure. Everyday was different- we would go to the aquarium, the outdoor market, the children’s science museum. I learned to be curious with an entire city as my playground. Some days, my mother would just hand me the transit map and let me pick the bus we would take. As long as I could get us back to where we started, downtown Seattle was my oyster. My absolute favorite day, we took the number 47 because I had just learned that you spelt four with a u, and forty without a u, and thought that was fascinating. I chose a stop because I noticed the biggest fountain I had ever seen! I vividly remember seeing it for the first time, realizing there was a pathway running straight through it, jumping right off the bus, and into the water. I stood in that fountain, running in and out of the falling curtains of water, for what felt like hours and hours. In the cold Seattle fall with my mother laughing in the background, I was the happiest and the most carefree I remember being.","I absolutely love surprises. Big or small. Intricately planned or a quick decision to hide behind a door and shout boo. To me, there is nothing more special than planning something for a friend without expecting anything in return and seeing the look on their face when they realize what has been done for them.

I am extremely clumsy. Because of this I have learned to laugh at myself with every failure and am rarely embarrassed. The other day, I walked into a sliding glass door in front of my entire staff and I laughed so hard I could not breath and tears were streaming down my face. I am unafraid to make the first bad dance move or take the first risk! 

I am super sentimental. I have shoeboxes filled with notes, postcards, and valentines going as far back as elementary school. I love collecting kind words and really value what people create and the words they choose to write. My wall is a collection of these postcards and letters that friends have written me.","I have been very  passionate about normalizing not being ok and being more honest when faced with the question of how are you! Honesty about how you are feeling is so important and people often feel they do not have the space to be heard or listened to if they express anything other than being good. Leading by example and being as an intentional as possible about creating the space to express vulnerability is something I am really excited for. This is something that can happen informally by being as intentional as possible in conversation or through activities and discussions.
","When I was in middle school, my dad was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. This is something that I never felt comfortable talking about due to my family’s private nature. With parents who were not big on affection, talking about emotions, and always reprimanded me when I cried. It often felt like I was supposed to act like an adult in the face of this new and confusing hardship. As a twelve year old who did not really understand cancer, have a support system to talk about what cancer was, or to even talk about the changes in our family dynamic, I really struggled. When an uncle who was integral to raising me passed away from liver cancer my freshman year of high school, I experienced that same confusion and hurt. Camp Kesem is the type of space and experience I desperately wished for years ago. While I did not have access to it then, I would love to be a part of creating it now for others. After my own experiences without a positive presence in my life during family members battles with cancer. The mission of Camp Kesem to create a safe, supportive, as well as fun space for children to be children is something I feel so incredibly passionate about.

This link is to an image of a carnation that I illustrated. While my parents were not very comfortable addressing emotions with me, my mom would sometimes surprise me with pink carnations when she came from work after my uncle passed away. Pink carnations represent gratitude and thankfulness towards meeting someone. Pink carnations now represent a dedication to being more open and comfortable with expressing how I am feeling and inspiring that in others!", (https://hillelatstanford.wufoo.com/cabinet/enlrZWg3azE3amFrMmk=/lyYg2Ag2cao%3D/),Leila Mengesha,11/6/18, (https://hillelatstanford.wufoo.com/cabinet/enlrZWg3azE3amFrMmk=/lyYg2Ag2cao%3D/),Leila Mengesha,12/6/18,12/6/18 23:07,public,12/6/18 23:59,public,128.12.254.132,6,1

Prior to this school year, I also went on a SPOT trip in Big Sur. I love the outdoors, and I love working with campers closer to my age. I feel like I can have deeper conversations and serve as a better counselor if we have shared experiences to draw on. In my senior year of high school, I was a counselor for my school's freshman retreat. We spent two days preparing for the trip - packing up supplies, designing games, organizing daytime activities, and undergoing training to serve as counselors for younger students. The trip itself lasted four days at Camp Longhorn, a sleepaway camp located in central Texas. On the trip, the counselors lived in cabins with a groups of roughly 15 freshmen. We spent the days either staying on camp grounds to do group-bonding activities, or travelling in the nearby area for outdoor activities and games.

","My family spent a lot of time moving around growing up, and maybe my favorite memory from that time was when we were living in Angola. We lived in a company, and all of the kids in the compound went to an international school fifteen minutes away. I started to get really close to the other kids around me, and, in my last year there, I felt like I had a really tight knit group of friends around me. We had this one game where we would walk around the compound with Nerf guns after class let out and ""ambush"" our friends, and I remember the first time it happened (it was with me). I heard a knock on my front door, and, as soon as the door opened, all my friends rushed in, Nerf guns in hand, yelling ""Ambush!!"". I remember sprinting to the back of my house, a smile stretched across my face, looking for a Nerf gun to fight back. Everything quickly devolved into an all-out dogfight - just picture a group of nine-year olds, sprinting around, screaming, Nerf guns firing. It was absolute chaos, but that memory always comes to mind when I think about growing up. ",,"I'd be really excited to teach ukulele lessons at camp.

Whether I was big sister Kathryn supporting and being a role model to the girls on our competitive team, or I was Ms. Kathryn helping them grow as dancers and artists, I loved being an influential part of their lives. The energy these girls and boys brought to class always inspired me to teach with enthusiasm and positivity. ","Role: Camp instructor

Description: A group I was involved with in high school that still holds a very special place in my heart was called Adaptive Physical Education. This was a program in which I was a “buddy” and was paired with a student in my school with special needs. I would attend their P.E. class with them and act as both a support system and friend, but my favorite part of this experience was not what went on in class but rather what happened outside of class. Although we were introduced to each other in the class, our friendship extended past the classroom, which is what made the experience so special and memorable.

Currently we are working toward making the class a cardinal course so Stanford students can volunteer their time to help assist the class while learning more about disability awareness and getting credit for their time as well. I cannot wait to see all we accomplish in this upcoming year.

Role: USVH Volunteer
Dates: September 2018-present
Description: Every Friday, I drive to the Menlo Park Veterans Hospital with other volunteers from the US Veterans Heath (USVH) organization. Growing up hearing stories from my dad who served in the army for eleven years, my respect and appreciation for our armed services has developed greatly. For two hours every week, I hear the veterans stories, ask them about their days, and build connections with them. Although it has only been one quarter, the experience so far has been absolutely amazing.
","My family has loved taking road trips since I was was in a car seat, and my favorite trip will always be the one which we drove west from our home in the Chicago suburbs. We ended up driving north first, stopping at the Mall of America in Minnesota followed by Mount Rushmore in South Dakota. While both destinations were amazing, the one that came next I will never forget. After driving through an awful hailstorm, we finally hit Wyoming and drove into Yellowstone National Park. Although the landscape was beautiful, the most amazing part was being so close to the wildlife. As we drove, packs of bison would cross in front of us or walk with us. They were an arms length away from our car and it was the most surreal experience I’d ever had. Being from a suburb, I never really got to interact with nature or appreciate all this world has to offer, and to finally get that experience, I realized all I was missing. I didn’t want to leave, and I can’t wait to go back.
","The first, and most important characteristic about me is my belief in positivity. Whether I gained this mindset from school, sports, music or dance I have no clue, but I strongly advocate for positive environments and keeping a positive mind. I believe you can’t change what happens to you in life, but you have such a powerful tool to decide how you react to it. Staying positive, in my opinion, is not easy by no means, but can really have an impact on your day to day life. Another characteristic of mine is my compassion and motherly-like qualities. I would always get labeled “mom” by my friends because I really care to see others make good decisions, succeed in what they do, and stay safe. I also really care for everyone's well being and was “that person” to bring someone hot tea and cough drops if they were ever sick. Last but not least, I love to have fun and be active. Sometimes I have to stop myself when I’m taking life too seriously to remind myself that taking a break from studying to go play volleyball with my friends or take a yoga class is extremely necessary. Although I consider myself mature, I also like to emphasize the importance of laughing, having fun, and just letting all your stress and worries go.","Honestly, anything!! Growing up, my mom put me in everything. I played soccer and basketball, was on the swim team, played trumpet, danced, joined theatre productions and the list goes on. I was not good at everything I did, but I learned not to be afraid to step out of my comfort zone. This is something I’d hope to apply as a counselor for Camp Kesem. No matter what I’d teach or facilitate, I want to show my campers that trying things out of your comfort zone should be looked at as fun experiences rather than scary.","The message of this organization struck my heart immediately. I knew the moment the representative at the Volunteer Fair finished telling me about this camp, it was something I did not want to leave Stanford this summer without doing. Personally, the camp’s message touches a place in my heart as my grandpa passed away from cancer when I was in 7th grade, and my other grandpa is currently fighting his battle with cancer. My grandparents live in Florida, which has been really hard on me since I only get to see him about two to three times a year. The hardest part has been knowing that his days are limited and not knowing when my last time seeing him will be, especially with me being farther than I was before. Whenever I start to get emotional about the subject, I find myself going to my escape – dance. When I dance I am able to release my feelings and worries and even if it’s just for a few minutes, I can let my mind go blank and be at peace. In hearing about this camp, I realized for many kids, this camp is to them what dance is to me. They are able to come and release their feelings and worries in an environment that’s here to support them and with counselors that are here to help them find their own peace, even if it’s just for a few minutes. To be a part of that would be an honor.","A great amount of my appreciation for diversity and my empathy toward people comes from the community I grew up in and specifically my high school experience. I came from a high school in which students didn’t finish their homework, not because they didn’t want to, but because they were working two jobs after school to help support their families. One of my teammates on my dance team would go to school at 8am, go to work right after school, come to practice, go to a different job until 3am and then do it all again the next day. Being surrounded by hard working students like her everyday not only contributed to my empathy but also my view that everyone should be kind and respectful, because you never know what someone is going through in life. This is an outlook I’d like to bring to camp. While all campers have something in common, they are also extremely diverse. I want to show them the importance of respecting each other and not judging a person for their exterior features because there’s a lot more to someone than what they let us see.
","Memories

Running, climbing, flying free
I’m as happy as can be
Today I will paint a picture
And tomorrow be the baseball pitcher

It’s been hard to see
The one I love not be carefree
I may be young, but I know
My whole family is on a low

Today is special, may i say
Since Camp Kesem starts today
I cannot wait to be
With loving people who care for me

Camp is where I go to be
Free from all anxiety
I can sing and talk and play
And all my fears will go away

I know when I leave
I’ll have made life lasting memories

Role: Dance Marathon Executive Board Member
Dates: 2018 
Description:  As part of Dance Marathon, we raise money for the Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital, to help families pay for their children to receive the treatment they need. It has been incredibly rewarding to be part of such a passionate community, and to be part of a greater cause. A lot of the time we are caught up in the daily mundanity of organizing fundraisers for the hospital that it is easy to forget the cause we are fighting for. But when I went with Dance Marathon to take a tour of the hospital, it was incredibly touching to see the impact we had, and seeing the families in the hallways of the hospital, knowing they were suffering and worrying for their child. 
","My grandma was beautiful. In a way that was graceful and strong and refined, she wore her wrinkles like the latest fashion trend. Even at age seven, I could see it, the part of her that could only be described as fabulous. And she and I, we were a team. I was her favorite, and she was mine. We made an obnoxiously cute duo, especially when singing karaoke.  My grandma didn’t have the privilege to learn to sing during her childhood, so her voice was good but never spectacular. But I always thought she was the best because of her passion, the way her mouth smiled during the breaks in the song, or the way she tapped her feet, almost in rhythm but just a beat ahead as if she was too eager to get to the next part. When we sang together, I was engulfed in her aura, I was part of her presence. Our favorite duet was Love Me Tender, by Elvis Presley, where I would try to make my voice as low as possible, usually barely able to contain my laughter. I was an aggressively mediocre singer, but when I sang with my grandma, we were a world famous band, making our mark in musical history. And it was that precise moment, the giggly, imperfect rendition of Love Me Tender, in beautiful exhilaration and harmony, that is my favorite childhood memory.","1) I still am an extremely average singer, but I would definitely get an A for effort.

2) I came to Stanford hesitant about following the premed track, and I honestly thought my time at Stanford was going to drive me away from medicine. However, with each quarter, I am more and more certain I wanted to be a practicing physician. I was also extremely undecided about which specialty I would like to pursue, but after spending time at the Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital, I think pediatrics is the route for me.

3) Even though I don’t have any formal experience with kids, I pinky promise I love them, and am generally loved by them!",Karaoke :) ,"The worst day of my life was not the day my grandma passed away after a long battle with lung cancer, but the day after. It wasn’t the day I held her cold frail hand in a hospital room, like a sad cliché from Grey’s Anatomy, and whispering I love you a billion times in her ear, hoping she could hear just one of them. It was going to school on Friday and having my friends loudly ask why I missed school yesterday. It was weighing my options of making an excuse, or telling my friends the truth but knowing my tears would be immediate and plentiful. 
I couldn't lie-I told my close friends that she was gone and the tears started flowing as I knew they would and I looked at my friends, and heard one whisper “Ahh I’m bad at these situations,” while the rest diverted their eyes. At the time, it hurt to not receive the support I sought from my friends. But with more distance and perspective, I understand that my friends wanted to be there for me, but were uncertain of how to do so.
Quite frankly, I don't think anyone really knows how to help someone through grief.
But I want to try. These kids are already suffering, and I want so badly to help create a space for them to feel safe, brave, and vulnerable, and to feel every emotion they need to experience before they can find the strength to push onwards.

This past summer I was a songleader for the first session and for the second session I was a songleader and a counselor. One of my favorite memories from this past summer was when I was able to accompany two cabins on an overnight trip.  Our camp's campsite is less than a mile from main camp and a truck carried the camper's sleeping bags and pillows to the campsite. I loved playing games with the campers, telling stories, and concluding the night with some great camp songs.  However, I wished that the campers could have learned how strong they truly were by having to carry all their belongings on their back for a long distance. When I was a camper at a different summer camp, I loved going backpacking with my age group. It made me feel empowered and connected to the people and earth around me.

","In August of every summer, my little sister and brother, twin sister, parents and I would drive out to our cousins’ house to stay over for a weekend.  Our grandma and grandpa would come too.  We would fill the day with games, sports, and other competitions.  I vividly remember losing to my sister in a dance battle to Soulja Boy’s “Kiss Me Thru The Phone.”  Grandma was the judge.  When it got really hot we’d jump into the ocean and claw to stay on the tube while whoever didn’t make it tried to pull us off.  As the day dropped into night we settled around the table for a dinner dominated by random bursts of energetic discussion that almost always ended with one or both sets of parents chastising us.  The best part, however, came after dinner.  My favorite childhood memory is when we would throw our dessert into our mouths and race outside to the pool.  We stripped off our clothes and pranced around the pool naked.  Sticking our hands under our armpits so that our elbows pointed out, we did the chicken dance as our parents and grandparents watched in what must’ve been a mix of shock and vicarious joy.  After we danced our hearts out we all jumped into the pool.  As we got older, the tradition began to get a little weird so we stopped.  But I’ll always remember the carefree fun.","I have three siblings, including a twin sister and a younger sister and brother who are twins.  In many ways, my identity has been forged by my siblings.  Every one of them has taught me something – love, patience, pain, other non-Arianna Grande-related words – that I carry with me today.  I am a better student/teacher/friend/son because of my siblings.

I love old-school hip-hop music.  It bounces and flows in a way that feels so inviting.  Whereas lots of songs speak to epic romance, hip-hop sounds like real life.  It tells real stories.  As someone who doesn’t naturally excel at music, I found hip-hop accessible and relatable.  I didn’t need to be a star to have something to say.  I could talk over a beat.  A couple years ago I started freestyle rapping for fun.  It’s one of my favorite things now to do with friends.

My sworn enemy is self doubt.  As a frosh RA this year, I’ve learned how insidious self doubt can be.  One of my biggest challenges is constantly assuaging my own anxieties about not doing a good job or not being able to relate to my residents.  At the same time, I can see my residents struggling with the same issue.  Self doubt is the invisible limit we impose on ourselves.  Having learned this truth, I am committed to fighting my own self doubt and encouraging others to do the same.  It’s something I still struggle with, but at least I now recognize its importance.
","I would be so excited to teach the enthralling topic of... mistake response!  It might not sound that engaging, but positively responding to mistakes is not only a crucial skill for life but also a fun way to encourage and support ourselves and one another.  I'd love to teach campers how to recognize when they or someone else is feeling down or distracted and how to show them support and hype them up if the situation calls for it.  I'm a huge proponent of knowing when to bring the spirit, the positive energy, and doing so unabashedly when necessary.","My biggest goal in life is to create or deepen a sense of community.  It’s my number one priority this year as a frosh RA, it’s my prized long-term goal for when I leave Stanford, and it’s the reason why I want to volunteer my time to Camp Kesem.  I want to build those personal relationships with campers and do what I can to enable them to deepen their relationships with one another.  I gain a deep satisfaction from making connections – real friendships – between others and with myself.  This desire holds true for all people, and it is especially true for children.  I love being around kids because I feed off of their energy and embrace their eagerness about things I take for granted.  Kesem is an even more special place because of the shared struggle that brings campers together.  I am ready to honor that unifying factor and serve these kids in their search for community.

Plus Kesem sounds like so much fun; I’d embrace the silliness and positive spirit that seems to ooze throughout everyone involved.  I want to bring my own spirit into the mix to be grown by and to help grow the Kesem magic.","I got depressed my senior year of high school.  I decided to take a year off afterwards; I knew I had to make big changes in my life to reclaim the sense of self I had lost.  I luckily got to live and work at a school in Gaborone, Botswana, where I lived among students between 11 and 20 years-old.  That school became my life.  I struggled a lot initially: I was still depressed, I felt lonely, I felt disconnected from the surrounding people who looked different and spoke in a different language than I.  Over the next few months, thanks mostly to their open hearts, I became enmeshed in their community.  The people around me evolved from students, players, co-workers, and teachers into family.  The Maru-a-Pula community embraced this random, lanky, white American as one of their own.  The day I left (before coming back the next summer) was the most emotional day of my life.  I’m generally stoic, but I cried like Niagara Falls that day.  They changed my life.  They taught me how a loving community transcends even the biggest superficial differences and reverberates across thousands of miles and multiple years.  Learning how to simultaneously join and help strengthen a community would help me support Kesem’s mission of cultivating the bonds and sense of community that last forever.  Having dealt with mental illness while entering a foreign community would allow me to relate to campers who are struggling to find their way or feel overwhelmed at Kesem.

","My favorite childhood memory is going to my Grandma’s house in the spring after the first couple of big rains of the year. It hardly ever rains in San Luis Obispo, but there is usually a couple of giant rainfalls one after the other in March. My grandparents own a little farm (which is barely big enough to be called as such) where they have a barn with one horse and a big field. After the first rain, the field grows grasses so tall that they literally extended over our heads as kids. 
	My younger sister and I would go out into the muddy field, barefoot, usually in shorts and t-shirts even if it was still cold, and run around in the field, hiding in the grass, throwing mud at each other, and rolling around and laughing until we couldn’t breathe. We made flower crowns out of daisies, had picnics, made up stories about being in the jungle or in the forest, and hid from one another in the grasses. It was the most carefree and wonderful traditions of my childhood, and I think about it a lot, especially as my grandparents have grown older and considered selling their farm. It was in those little moments that my sister and I grew so close, and have remained best friends until this day. 
","I am a believer in the power of positive thinking. I tell myself everyday that the day will be a good day, that I will accomplish something, and remind myself to have gratitude. I set tiny goals for myself everyday, ones that give me a sense of purpose and accomplishment. They can be as tiny as putting away my shoes as soon as I take them off, or as large as trying to stay off of my phone for a whole day. Goal setting and positivity really propels me to stay grateful and self-aware even as academic life becomes stressful. 

I consider myself a very creative and artistic person. As an art history major, I have a deep appreciation for all kinds of art. While at Stanford, I’ve really learned how to find relaxation and joy in creating art, writing, and exploring new activities. I try to really push myself to be more creative in my everyday life, whether it means taking a product design class outside of my major, taking photos, or just writing in my journal.

I feel most at home in the outdoors. I come from a small town on the central coast of California that has s many beautiful places to hike, surf, and explore. I am so lucky to have grown up spending most of my time outside, and I try spend most of my free time in nature, whether its just laying on a field outside, or exploring the hikes around Palo Alto. 

","I would love to teach a gymnastics workshop at camp. I have a background in gymnastics coaching and it is such a universally fun activity to involve kids of all ages in. It helps many kids to burn off energy, to find joy in the fun things that they can accomplish with their bodies, and to just simply get kids moving in a flexible and enjoyable environment where they can also learn some cool skills! 
","I want to volunteer my time to Camp Kesem because I believe it is the most meaningful way I can use my experience with children and to give back to an incredibly deserving community. In the twelve years I did gymnastics, both as an athlete and coach, I found the most meaning in becoming invested in the families and the children that were a part of our team. I encountered incredibly strong families who had dealt with horrible and devastating events in their lives, and continued to live meaningful, strong lives with resilience and persistence that I cannot even fathom. 
Last year, the mother of my one best friends and teammates passed away. In the months following her death, I learned how important it is for families who experience tragic things to be uplifted by their communities. Camp Kesem not only uplifts, but also empowers kids to be able to take a break from the stress and the worry of their lives. By being a part of the counselor community, I know that I can lend not only a helping hand, but a listening ear and a positive attitude to the children attending camp. The fulfillment and product of Kesem is not that it cures cancer or resolves the hardships, but that it provides a powerful respite of postivity and laughter, which sometimes all someone needs to get through one more day.

Dates: October 2015 – Present (started Freshman Year)
Description: In addition to being an active member of the team for 3+ years, I have held the year-long roles of Recruitment Chair and Food Manager and served as captain in some matches.
","The year is 2004. The setting: Phillips Brooks Elementary School. I wait eagerly inside Mr. Stanley’s classroom. For years, I have come through and ogled what 2nd graders before me have made. But this year was different. This year was my turn. The most anticipated day of the year: Dino Day.

My school had many special days when class projects would be showcased. For example, the 3rd grade Indian Bazaar or the 5th grade American Revolutionary Era Wax Museum. But it all paled in comparison to Dino Day. For weeks, I had meticulously turned a Nike shoe box into the grassy wetlands of the late Jurassic. I had sculpted, torn apart, and resculpted my herd of Allosauruses. My spiral bound report on the Allosaurus sits next to my shoebox Dino-rama on my desk. 

Mr. Stanley is your typical cool-guy teacher. He pulls out his electric guitar – a rare treat for the class – and rocks out ‘Wild Thing’ in his skinny jeans. Dino Day has begun. Students and parents and siblings meander through the 2nd grade classrooms. I stand next to my creation, beaming. Eventually, I wander to look at other projects. T Rex. Mainstream. Pterodactyl. Is it even a dinosaur? In my head, I pronounce my project to be the best. As the showcase wraps up, I take a picture with my sister and parents. The day is spent half-real, half-imaginary…lost in the world of the dinosaurs. It is the best day of the year.
","1. My first day of being a camp counselor, I was terrified. I wanted every kid to like me, but acted so nervously that none of them did. I took a step back and focused on the bigger picture. It wasn’t about me; what really mattered was that my campers were safe, engaged, and having fun. This approach worked until I became comfortable in my role. From then on, I was more relaxed and had a blast being a counselor. 

2. I am a big fan of dress up or themed anything! I am not sure if there are skits or other opportunities for this during the week, but if so I am very, very down.

3. I hold my commitments near and dear. I tend not to do something if I can’t truly commit to it. This hesitancy can be a fault; there are times I wished I had jumped into a new role or organization that I was unsure I could manage. It does mean, however, that I am applying to be a counselor at Kesem fully ready and willing to give it my all.
","I would be excited to bring my guitar and lead campfire songs. I have found that singing or music is a good way to show that nobody is too cool to join in group fun (who’s too cool for a little John Denver?!). I have also always loved sports, and would be excited to facilitate anything with a ball, whether a real sport or a made-up game.
","Last December, my dad was diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome, a form of blood cancer. He continues to fight today. Throughout this year, and looking forward to the future, I have learned what a destabilizing force cancer can be on a person and a family. Since his diagnosis, I have struggled with the guilt of always wanting to do what I can for him, but knowing that he wants me to live my like normal.  

I am applying to Kesem because I want to help others grappling with similar situations. When I think of what I can bring to Kesem, my mind immediately goes to tangible acts that can make Camp a fun place for kids: being energetic, being a friend, not taking myself too seriously. I can only imagine, but if I were coping with my dad’s cancer ten years younger, these are the traits I imagine would help me enjoy the moment and feel normal for a week. 

At the same time, I know that my instinct towards distracting fun and games is, at least in part, because it is easier than confronting head-on how I am feeling. The times when I have felt best, however, have come when I have balanced ‘normal’ fun experiences with acceptance of the aspects of life that are uncontrollably different when a parent has cancer. Talking about my struggles is still fresh for me, but I hope that through Kesem, I can learn to use my experiences to be an ally for others.",,"https://youtu.be/4w3jarl5tnw

Because they campers would be much closer to us in age,  I think that it would be really easy to empathize with them and give advice. I have two younger sisters in this age group so I have a lot of experience dealing with angsty teenagers, and it wasn’t too long ago that I was one myself. I also worked at a program at MIT this past summer with 15/16-year-olds so I'm comfortable with the age group in a non-family setting as well, learning how to walk the line between allowing them to be comfortable and asserting myself when necessary. I don't think I have too much experience with respect to proper outdoor training but I love the outdoors and absolutely be willing to expand my skill set to best be able to serve the campers.
","Role: Residential Advisor @ MOSTEC Conference at MIT
Dates: August 2018
Description: I was co-responsible for a group of 20 high school students in getting them to and from classes and activities both on and off campus for 24/7. We were also responsible for planning events for the larger group of 120 students along with the rest of our staff.
",I don't have any experience working at a camp. :),"Last year, I was a member of Frosh Council which was my main community here on campus. I loved every moment of the organization, not only because of the work that we did. I found it really meaningful that the work we were doing was dedicated to increasing the community among our classmates. I found the internal community of Frosh Council even more important for myself because I made so many close friendships that I have kept through this year and I plan to keep through the rest of my years and Stanford, and life. I felt really invested in the community so I made a great amount of effort to make sure that I got to know everyone, and planned small events to make sure that we all got to know each other outside of our weekly meetings. 
I am also invested in my dorm community, I was really invested in my freshman dorm last year and worked really hard to plan events and encouraging each other to get to know each other at a deeper level than simply acknowledging each other's existences. My closest friends at Stanford are from my freshman dorm, and I have continued to try to be invested in my new community this year.
Lastly, this year I also joined a strange community. I am currently taking CS107E which is the hardest class that I have ever taken at Stanford. Despite all of the struggle and the pain, I made one of my new best friends in the class. It is my first class at Stanford where I felt that I truly knew everyone in the class and how willing everyone is willing to help each other in a way that I have never experienced. I hope that I am able to find a community like this in my classes in the future as well and through new groups at Stanford. 
Coming from a big family, the community has always been really important to me because I am so used to having close friendships and people that I constantly feel comfortable with. 
","When I was a child I lived in a relatively rural area. On my whole street, there were only 2 other kids the same age as me so we would spend a lot of time together, usually outside. My favorite memory is from when I was 6 years old and my friend Kristen from down the street was throwing a Halloween party. The memory stands out to me, not because of the party, but because for the first time at the ripe age of 6, I was granted permission to walk to my friend’s Halloween party alone in the dark. It seems silly, but at that moment I was just excited to run as fast as I could to see my friends and eat outrageous amounts of candy. Looking back now, however, I realize how fortunate I was to live in such an amazing community where I was safe and comfortable. A neighborhood where the adults cared enough about each other that as children we felt safe and welcome at all times, even when we weren’t on our own property. That sense of comfort and excitement that I had running all .5 miles to my neighbor's house in a pink dress is something that I have since sought to recreate. I hope that any sort of new community that I am able to join can offer me a similar feeling. I also hope that I will be able to make an impact on the community, and provide it for others. 
","I want you to know that I am really excited about Camp Kesem. Cancer has had a great emotional toll in my life, and the idea that anything that I can do in the world can allow somebody to more easily cope with the pain of losing a family member or dealing with the pain that is cancer treatment would mean that whatever I am doing with my life is of actual importance. I also want you to know that I am a lot. By a lot, I mean that when I get excited I am not afraid to show my excitement and how much something means to me. I feel comfortable expressing myself in a very loud and passionate way, so hopefully, some of that can rub off on campers. Lastly, I love children. As an older sister, it has become a part of my instinct to want to instill knowledge in people younger than me. 

","I want to meet kids how to make stop motion videos! I think that it is a lot of fun, and it gives the kids something that they can show off when it is created. I think that it can give the students the opportunity to express themselves with a skill that they can take home with themselves and continue to beyond camp as a form of art. 


","Cancer has changed my life through the loss of loved ones many times in my life. Kesem stands out to me as a group that I want to join because the program does not look at the background of anybody except the fact that their families have been affected by cancer. I think that that is a beautiful thing that socio-economic status cannot affect how this program can help students. I think that Kesem would have had an amazing impact on my life when cancer was a huge part of my life during my childhood, and I think that it would make me incredibly happy to know that I can make an impact on at least one child's life and how they cope with something so awful.

","I had just recently started watching How I Met your Mother with my sister. Every day, coming home from school, we'd make quesadillas together, sit down, and watch one episode. 
 
Inspired by Barney Stintson’s adventures in the show, when I went to Philadelphia on a school trip, and visited the liberty bell with my class, I had an idea of what I had to do. Being a historic monument, the bell was surprisingly unguarded. And I was determined to lick it. 

I waited for the guards and my teachers to walk around, and I got into position. I got close, close enough to smell the musty, bright scent of copper, and I knew that the sweet taste of liberty would be unforgettable. 

But, I hesitated. And turning around my teachers looked at me curiously. My time to shine had passed. So close, yet so far.

Now every time I re-watch an episode of How I Met Your Mother, I associate it with the taste of homemade quesadillas. I feel a little resurgent burst of adrenaline as I see Barney do his shenanigans, knowing that they are quite achievable. ","1) I am ethnically ambiguous. Most recently I’ve gotten (by different people) Algerian, Colombian, half-Indian, and Italian. Essentially, every continent except Antarctica (I’m still waiting on that one). I’d say that most of the time, this has worked to my advantage. I’ve been offered beer by a Moroccan (who kept on talking to me in Arabic until he realized that I really didn’t understand) last summer after having swallowed what seemed like half the ocean after surfing. And even in daily life I’ve had interesting conversations about my name (a “Mauricio” with a last name like “Wulfovich” can seem like a clash of cultures). My mixed background has added to my day to day life in ways that I could’ve never imagined.

2) For the past nine years, I've played guitar whenever I've had the chance. My favorite time is jamming with friends around the acoustic guitar at night, laughing while we mess up song lyrics. 

3) I love backpacking: When I hike up a mountain and my legs feel like they’re about to fall off but I make it anyways, I prove to myself that I have it in me. Hiking quickly, my glasses fog, the bright colors around me swirl, my thumping chest feels like it’s on fire, but I continue. I continue because I prove to myself that I can handle it, that I have it in me to overcome.","I'd love to teach how to make pizza from scratch. Surprising tip: if you crack raw eggs on pizza before you put them into the oven, they cook deliciously.","In 2012, as my parents dropped me off at science fair to present a project I’d spent the last year developing, my mom got a call. It was her doctor. My mom’s breast biopsy results were back. She had breast cancer. 

I’ve never been good at processing emotions. And especially as an eighth grader, I didn’t know what to do about anything. I didn’t know how to deal with my mom that was constantly crying. I was only able to somehow find solace in studying and playing guitar.

Though radiation therapy was tough on my mom, I was at a summer camp, throughout what I later learned, were the toughest parts. I think it was for the best that I was distracted, and that my parents were able to deal with it together, without having to always think about me and my siblings.

Dealing with a parent’s cancer is tough. If I can make the kids’ and families’ summer the tiniest bit better, I’m doing the greatest good.","Through the lens of Diego Rivera’s The Flower Festival, hanging on my bedroom wall, I see the saturated colors of my Mexican heritage. I see myself holding my grandparents’ hands, walking along flower stands in Mexico City’s Bazaar del Sabado, eating fresh tamales. 

When my family moved to America, I learned a new language and culture. But as the only Latino in my elementary school, I often felt ashamed of being an immigrant. My face would turn bright red when I would hear my classmates giggle at my incorrectly translated Mexican idioms. 

Years later, when I watched Zhuolun, a Stanford student from China, eat lunch at a table of only Chinese students, I joined him. Through our regular conversations, I realized that we face the same challenge of embracing our American reality while being proud of our heritage. Soon we were going to soccer games and on dumpling-eating tours. And by sharing our culture, we kindled a new-found passion for our communities. Zhuolun became an activist in the API community. And I became a Spanish interpreter with the law school Immigration Pro Bono.

Over spring break, when Zhuolun came to dinner with my family, he brought me a poster of his favorite painting, Fu Baoshi’s Landscapes of the Four Seasons. The piece reminded him of the rivers and mountains--and his family--in Northern China. I hung it next to The Flower Festival. As I step back, the paintings blur into each other, becoming one story of immigration, acculturation, and finally belonging.","I haven't really written much music, but here are some little snippets that I made!

• Established free monthly math classes for 200+ students serving 18 schools in Maui County
• Designed visual and tactile math curriculum ","In 4th grade, my father decided to put me in taekwondo classes. I was initially hesitant to join because push-ups were hard for 9 year old Jasmine, but fortunately, I grew to love the sport. Because my parents were quite focused on academics, this sport freed me from my room. Within a few weeks, I had overcome fear of making mistakes in front of people and was excited to talk to my new friends at class. It was rewarding to attend class because I could see my legs becoming more flexible each day as I was able to reach higher heights. After a few months, I found my instructor asking me if I would like to lead the little kid's class. I was worried that I would be a bad example for the students, but after encouragement from my father, I decided to give it a try. As I met face to face with my students, I could not but feel a rush of excitement flowing through my body. They were all so excited to learn that they could not keep still. After the warmup, I had the opportunity to help students sharpen their martial art form and give them tips improve their kicking and punching technique. I remember the high five one of the students gave me after she had mastered a form. Taekwondo played such an important role in helping me blossom from my quiet self as well as helping me see the beauty of teaching and serving. ","I believe that it is very important to be thankful for what you have, so I always make it a point to write a thank you letter to my teachers during christmas/new years. I try to show my appreciation for everyone who has helped me because I believe that my success is a combination of my personal skills and from my outside resources. I view every physical material and human relationship as a gift that I need to thankful for.

My core value of empathy fuels my commitment to social work. As a daughter of Asian-American immigrants, I have endured the difficulties of reconciling cross-cultural contexts as well as the struggles of being low-income. My personal experience has made me a strong advocate in having multiple support networks and specifically building classroom environments where people care for individuals holistically: mentally, physically, emotionally, and spiritually. 

Lastly, my faith has played an important role in helping me recognize my purpose in life is to serve others humbly and wholeheartedly. Because the mission of Kesem aligns with my call to serve, I am committed to devoting my 110% effort to ensure the children have the best experience possible.","I would be excited to teach zumba dance because in high school, I would go to zumba classes and I found they were a great way to exercise and have fun. I would also be interested in teaching students how to play card games because I think they are a great way to build small communities and to also teach strategy. ","Growing up, I had this deep conviction that every human life matters and every child should have access to a quality education. When I watched Waiting for Superman in 8th grade, it confirmed to me our education system was far from equal. Our natural tendency to surround ourselves with people who think alike and come from similar backgrounds build walls between us. This saddens me but also informs me that I have to be intentional in empowering the voices of marginalized populations to create equity. This coming fall, I have decided to pursue a career in teaching because I would like to serve the youth in our society who have so much potential to restore our world. Because studies have shown students are able to perform better and develop a relationship with their teachers if their teacher can relate to their struggles and background, I would be honored to have this opportunity to support these children who are going through one of the most difficult situations in their life. My father who raised himself has reminded me that caring for children requires much patience and love especially to care for all of their needs - academic, social and emotional. This summer, I would like to grow in love and patience not only for my personal growth, but also to prepare me for loving students in the classroom.","I believe my background in education will serve us well in the ways we design and teach activities for the students. During high school, I was involved with organizing and teaching math workshops for elementary school students on Maui as well as coaching the middle and high school math at my school. I have experience developing and executing lesson plans and have worked with my brothers to publish math workbooks. Secondly, I have organized class trips as a Alternative Spring Break leader. During the trip, we studied the history of Vietnamese immigration and the circumstances and conditions under which Vietnamese live and flourish in the U.S. and visited nearby community organizations.","https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DaESfaofXh0dNHJTIwA7w4-I1ORYtQ8B/view?usp=sharing

Dates: September 2017 - June 2018
Description: Last year I was a frosh RA in Otero. I planned community events for the eighty-five person dorm as well as served as a mentor and leader for the freshman residents.","When I was in second grade, Dylan was my best friend in the entire world. It was one of those relationships you can only get as a six-year-old, where activities as simple as making goofy faces to each other across the room in Ms. Drumb’s class and playing spies on the playground were the most fun activities in the world. 

In third grade, we were in the same class again and remained as close as ever until November when his family moved to Colorado.

A month later, my parents told my sister and me that they were getting a divorce. 

The rest of my third-grade year was spent splitting time between two very different houses and struggling to find friends in a school that seemed filled with strangers without my best friend. 

At the beginning of summer break, my mom flew with me to Colorado so that I could spend the week with Dylan. For that week, it felt like everything was back to normal. It was so natural to start our friendship right where we left off and spend our days the same way we used to when he lived in Tennessee. For that time, I was able to forget about everything back home and just enjoy the time I had with my best friend.

I still have a photo from that trip on my desk. The smiles on mine and Dylan’s faces are contagious, and every time I look at it I can’t help but feel happy. 
","I’m weird, and I’m proud to be weird. I pride myself in my ability to always bring the wacky energy to the room. I’m not afraid to be loud, I’m not afraid to be bold, and I’m not afraid to embarrass myself. 

I love animals, especially marine mammals. I think my favorite question to ask anyone between the ages of six and one hundred and six is “what’s your favorite animal and why?” The smartest of those people will say something along the lines of “that’s impossible to answer.” It is a truly ridiculous question. All animals are perfect in their own niche. Evolution is amazing in that way. 

I know every single word to the Hamilton soundtrack. Over the past two years, my music taste has devolved from basically nothing to only broadway songs, and I have no idea why. If you see me skateboarding to class, it’s probably “Defying Gravity” playing. Studying in Green Library? Les Mis, movie soundtrack. Someone wants me to put on a song at a party? Dear Evan Hansen, probably “Waving Through a Window”. I still haven’t decided if my obsession is something I should be proud or ashamed of. 
","At the running camp where I worked, my favorite “Fun Friday” game to play was called the Circle of Life. 

To play circle of life, you split the kids into three different teams, herbivores, omnivores, and carnivores (denoted by facepaint, obviously). They are given multiple wristbands that represent “lives” that they have. The counselors are all different resources, whether that be berries, water, acorns, shelter, etc.  

As the name suggests, the goal of the game is to survive and gather resources, making it a fun combination of tag and hide and go seek that’s fun kids and counselors alike. 
","Over the past few years, I’ve tried to figure out where I derive joy and meaning in the communities and activities that I choose to dedicate my time too. While this internal quest for fulfillment is far from over, I have found that I find happiness when I can see the direct positive impact that my actions have in other people’s lives. I will go to bed with a smile on my face if I know that what I’ve done that day has had a lasting positive impact on someone else. 

Through Camp Kesem, I’ll be able to provide kids a space where they can have fun. Where they can escape their lives, just for a little bit, to a world that feels magic. I know that the work will be tough. It will be emotionally draining. It will be different than any other kids camp, and that difference is why I want to volunteer.

As a Camp Kesem volunteer, you build an experience for the kids that, for many of them, has a lasting positive impact. You give them a space to talk about what they’re going through, but also to play, to have fun, to be wacky, to be a kid. It’s an experience that I know I will find so much joy in helping to create.
