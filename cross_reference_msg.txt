Welcome! This script is here to help you cross reference applications with letters of
reference. It detects...

    • Applicants who have more than one letter of reference. If this occurs,
      the applicant's name will show up twice under "Referee".

    • Applicants who have no matching letter of reference. If this occurs,
      the applicant's Reference and Referee columns will be missing.

    • Letters of reference with no matching applicant. This is shown as a row in the  
      table below whose Applicant and Email columns are missing. 

    • Applicants who have partial matches to one or more letters of reference.
      This means the applicant's first or last name (but not both) matches those
      on the listed letters of reference. Usually, this means the reference
      spelled the applicant's name wrong, but sometimes can mean that the applicant
      doesn't have a letter of reference. You will have to decide this for yourself.
      If partial matches occur, the applicant's Referee column will partially match
      the applicant's name.
